00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.144
(Lee Joo Young)

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:21.855
(Ji Seung Hyun)

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:31.932
(Koo Jun Hoe)

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.810
(Mom)

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:50.050
(No Mercy)

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.053
(All characters, organizations, groups,)

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.054
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:57.758 --> 00:00:59.126
- Open it.
- What?

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:02.829
No way.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.898
Damn, dude.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.233
I think I just went blind...

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:09.102
all of a sudden.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.005
Whatever's dazzling my eyes...

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:14.274
has to be the light, right?

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.343
Thank you.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:18.111
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.980
I threw in some extra,

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:23.350
so send me solid guys this time.

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:26.820
Reliable ones, not like those flakes
who keep bailing on me.

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:29.356
Keep that shit up
and we'll have problems.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.557
You got it.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.192
I'll...

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:35.529
round up every sharp guy in Korea,

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:38.398
whip them into shape,

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.502
and deliver them straight to your door.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.706
So don't you worry.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.076
And that thing we discussed last time...

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:54.414
You said one of your operations
got shut down, right?

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:58.151
So I went ahead...

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:00.988
and brought this hotshot with me today.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.857
Hey, come on in.

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:11.131
It's an honor to meet you.

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:13.467
Meet Lee Seung Tae.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:17.638
In this field,
phones, shops, and cards,

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:21.742
you name it,
this guy's got it all locked down.

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:25.913
Basically, he's like the cannon.

00:02:26.547 --> 00:02:27.447
All right.

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:34.521
So you're the cannon.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.491
Let's blow something up together.

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:38.792
Boom.

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:40.160
You got it.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.229
I'll take care of the supply, no problem.

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:45.799
Let's have a drink.

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.401
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.006
Nice.

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:56.243
Speaking of which,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.580
Let's see what you're really made of.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.814
I need a favor.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.919
I'll make it worth your while.

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:10.858
Sorry, but what kind of test...

00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:29.510
(No Mercy)

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:52.032
(Episode 2)

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.872
Based on your dad's phone records,

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:00.474
we've confirmed that your mom's missing

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:05.212
is linked with the Ilseong clan.

00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:08.115
It's our case now.

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:15.022
Hang in there.

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.624
If you hear anything about your mom,
call me right away...

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.092
You think those scumbags

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:22.462
will actually pay?

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:26.500
Of course.

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.869
When we catch them,
they're looking at least...

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:30.337
What, for how long?

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:32.706
Five years?

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.210
Maybe ten for whoever's running it?

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:41.815
So Min.

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:45.052
I know how hard this is for you right now.

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:46.553
They do their time, get out,

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:49.122
and they're square with the law.

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:54.561
That's not justice.

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:56.463
That's just killing time
until they're back on the streets.

00:04:58.332 --> 00:05:00.400
I don't believe in
the law's idea of justice.

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:06.273
Then trust me instead.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.212
Forget the law. Trust me.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:15.816
I think we'll be able to
find your mom soon.

00:05:16.517 --> 00:05:17.384
How?

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:20.254
Where's my mom?

00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:16.243
(Missing Person)

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:18.378
You sure this is her?

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.215
I'm good with faces.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.217
Definitely.

00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:26.386
When and where exactly did you see her?

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.856
Two days ago,
I saw her at Seongan Intersection Station,

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:31.358
then today at City Hall Station.

00:06:31.358 --> 00:06:33.593
So mostly around subway stations.

00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:36.196
Did you notice anything unusual...

00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:38.165
about her?

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:41.034
She didn't look homeless or anything,

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.305
but every time I saw her,
she's got the same outfit on.

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:48.675
That's when it clicked,
after seeing the missing person banner.

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:50.644
So the clothes were always the same.

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:53.113
Other than the subway stations,

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:55.516
have you seen her anywhere else?

00:06:55.516 --> 00:06:56.450
Right.

00:06:57.284 --> 00:07:00.854
I once saw her entering a building
over by Gyodong Elementary School.

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:02.155
A building?

00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:10.063
Yes, she was carrying a backpack.

00:07:10.464 --> 00:07:11.899
That's near my place.

00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:34.621
I should've seen this coming
when you started talking about acting.

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:37.024
So it finally came to this disaster.

00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:38.959
What? You dropped out?

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.629
If I'd asked, you never would've let me.

00:07:43.197 --> 00:07:44.798
We should've talked about this.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.200
You're just letting me know
what you decided.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.168
You decided on your own and just told me.

00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:51.738
What did you expect me to say?
"Great, sweetheart?"

00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:55.375
I tried talking to you before. You said
you were busy and just walked off.

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:57.044
I don't want to hear it.

00:07:57.044 --> 00:07:59.313
Get back to that school
and undo this mess right now.

00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:02.216
What do you mean, undo it?
You can't just cancel it.

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:04.718
Why can't it be done?
I'll do it, now move aside.

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:06.019
What could you possibly do?

00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:07.921
So Min.

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:09.756
You worked yourself to the bone

00:08:09.756 --> 00:08:12.125
to get into the police academy.
Won't you regret throwing that away?

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:13.093
Not at all.

00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:15.395
You think this is all just a game?

00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:16.763
You think acting's easy?

00:08:16.763 --> 00:08:19.132
You think you can just work hard

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:21.668
and make it like school?

00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:23.637
I'll grovel at that school if I have to.

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:25.138
I'll cancel it.
Get out of my way.

00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:27.307
Where do you think you're going?
What are you going to do about it?

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:29.009
- Who says I can't?
- Seriously.

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:31.078
Forget it! I'll go.

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:33.914
I can't stand this anymore.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.718
Don't you walk away from me!

00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:45.726
I can't believe this.
That's what I raised?

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.461
She's everything to me.

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:35.309
(Mom)

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:42.015
Min.

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:44.184
I'm terrified.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.087
They hit me with a car

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.622
and won't let me go home.

00:09:50.357 --> 00:09:51.191
You're lying.

00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:53.360
What?

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:55.796
Who are you?

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.565
You can't even recognize
your own mother's voice?

00:09:58.565 --> 00:10:00.033
How disappointing.

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:04.404
Who the hell are you? Where's my mom?

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:06.874
Mom.

00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:08.509
Your mommy?

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:15.549
Your mom's...

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:17.918
always right there with you, sweetheart.

00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:20.053
Shut up, you sick freak.

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:23.257
I want my mom right now!

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.459
I'm so scared.

00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:27.928
You need to watch your mouth, kid.

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:30.898
You just crossed that line big time.

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:34.568
But you know what?

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.205
I wasn't lying about that part.

00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:40.407
What the hell are you talking about?

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.609
That mom you're looking for?

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.246
She's right there with you. Look around.

00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:48.315
She's around me?

00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:50.217
Yes.

00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:52.486
You'll find her yourself, won't you?

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.490
Then my job's done here.

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:08.035
The number you have dialed is
no longer in service.

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:20.080
(SOS, I need help.)

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.181
(That was a false alarm.)

00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:27.788
(SOS message will be sent
to My Wife shortly.)

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.991
(My wife)

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:32.025
(Husband)

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:39.166
(Seongan Intersection Station)

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.605
(Seongan Intersection Station, Exit 1)

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:08.729
Are you all right?

00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:24.711
(My wife, SOS, I need help.)

00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:43.830
Excuse me.

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:12.759
This doesn't add up.

00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:16.430
She's wearing the same clothes
from the day she went missing,

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.132
and wandering around her neighborhood
every day?

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:22.870
Someone must be behind this.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.771
So I looked into those buildings

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:26.807
near Gyodong Elementary School.

00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:28.575
And guess what?

00:13:28.942 --> 00:13:29.810
Check this out.

00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:31.712
(Olim Telecom)

00:13:31.712 --> 00:13:33.146
Olim Telecom.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.782
I looked into this prepaid phone company.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.118
Something stinks about it.

00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:39.319
Fishy as hell.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:42.022
Their sales numbers are way too high.

00:13:42.022 --> 00:13:43.290
Okay, that's got to be it.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.826
They're selling personal information...

00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:47.160
through burner phones.

00:13:47.528 --> 00:13:48.428
Exactly.

00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:52.165
I bet they're using missing people
to move these phones around.

00:13:53.634 --> 00:13:54.668
Let's go.

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:55.569
Time to shut this shit down.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.171
Shit?

00:14:20.394 --> 00:14:22.563
- I know you.
- What do you want?

What do I do?

00:26:19.546 --> 00:26:20.480
Hold on.

00:26:20.781 --> 00:26:21.748
Hold on.

00:26:23.417 --> 00:26:24.651
What do I do?

00:26:45.472 --> 00:26:46.673
Damn bastards.

00:27:52.806 --> 00:27:55.108
(I hope this helps. I'm sorry.)

00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:07.988
(I hope this helps. I'm sorry.)

00:28:11.124 --> 00:28:12.259
This won't work.

00:28:14.895 --> 00:28:16.697
I can't do this.

00:30:01.168 --> 00:30:02.302
Hi.

00:30:02.302 --> 00:30:04.304
This is Kim Mi Yang...

00:30:04.304 --> 00:30:06.773
from Dajeong Home Shopping,
We care for you like family.

00:30:11.778 --> 00:30:13.614
What can I do for you?

00:30:16.884 --> 00:30:17.851
How...

00:30:21.488 --> 00:30:22.823
Like I said,

00:30:22.823 --> 00:30:24.057
your mommy's right there with you.

00:30:24.992 --> 00:30:26.026
News says...

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.062
they're using voice technology
to catch us.

00:30:29.696 --> 00:30:31.431
So I got smart.

00:30:33.433 --> 00:30:35.469
Answer was right here.

00:30:37.905 --> 00:30:40.874
One voice, perfect disguise.

00:30:41.275 --> 00:30:43.610
So I borrowed your mom.

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:47.047
I'm going to kill you.

00:30:47.447 --> 00:30:49.850
Come on, you're scaring me.

00:30:50.484 --> 00:30:51.518
Fine.

00:30:51.518 --> 00:30:53.787
I'll pay you for her voice.

00:30:55.455 --> 00:30:56.290
What?

00:30:57.758 --> 00:30:58.659
Yeah,

00:30:59.059 --> 00:31:00.360
Ha So Min.

00:31:01.495 --> 00:31:02.596
I finally found you.

00:31:03.363 --> 00:31:05.766
You wench, where's your mom?

00:31:05.966 --> 00:31:08.168
- Where did you hide her?
- What are you talking about?

00:31:08.168 --> 00:31:10.170
You're in on this too, right?

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.405
Let go!

00:31:18.779 --> 00:31:22.549
That crazy Kim Mi Yang
turned my son into a criminal.

00:31:24.985 --> 00:31:27.888
I can't live like this.
How am I supposed to live?

00:31:29.089 --> 00:31:31.058
How can I go on?

00:31:32.192 --> 00:31:33.126
What?

00:31:34.728 --> 00:31:36.263
What did you say?

00:31:44.638 --> 00:31:46.940
(Job posting)
(Manager Kim Mi Yang)

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.043
My son answered this job posting.

00:31:50.777 --> 00:31:53.447
Now he's a criminal.

00:31:54.314 --> 00:31:56.750
(Manager Kim Mi Yang)

00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:10.931
Festival's all set.

00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:11.965
Good work.

00:32:12.432 --> 00:32:14.001
That mess before,

00:32:14.001 --> 00:32:16.303
I heard a cop's sniffing around.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.906
Don't worry about it.

00:32:19.673 --> 00:32:22.342
Chairman handled it.

00:32:23.544 --> 00:32:26.413
He always comes through
when we need him.

00:32:26.413 --> 00:32:27.347
But...

00:32:28.282 --> 00:32:31.752
About the development fund
we send each month...

00:32:32.319 --> 00:32:33.187
What about it?

00:32:33.187 --> 00:32:35.889
Looks like he used it to expand
the Dongsan clan...

00:32:35.889 --> 00:32:37.024
in Qingdao.

00:32:37.424 --> 00:32:38.325
What?

00:32:39.126 --> 00:32:41.828
Damn it, that crazy old geezer.

00:32:43.363 --> 00:32:46.266
I think he might be trying to
keep us in check.

00:32:48.335 --> 00:32:51.205
That's just how he is.

00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:54.975
If business keeps growing,

00:32:54.975 --> 00:32:57.110
I'll get you your own crew.

00:32:58.178 --> 00:33:00.214
Keep it running smooth.

00:33:00.214 --> 00:33:01.381
Do good work.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:04.985
Don't worry.

00:33:15.195 --> 00:33:16.930
Fuck, if it weren't for that bitch,

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:18.565
I would've handled this already.

00:33:19.132 --> 00:33:20.067
What should we do?

00:33:21.134 --> 00:33:24.438
Call the Macau guys.

00:33:24.905 --> 00:33:27.674
See if we can hook up with Singapore LTM.

00:33:28.609 --> 00:33:30.811
Damn, time to break off on my own.

00:33:31.278 --> 00:33:32.246
You got it, sir.

Here's what matters.

00:33:48.028 --> 00:33:50.831
All these Kim Mi Yang calls...

00:33:52.165 --> 00:33:54.268
use the same woman's voice.

for people looking for work.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.245
You got a minute?

00:34:05.879 --> 00:34:08.382
Yeah, sure.

00:34:09.183 --> 00:34:10.817
This is my third try.

00:34:11.151 --> 00:34:12.586
If this doesn't work out,

00:34:13.153 --> 00:34:14.655
I want to kill myself.

00:34:15.088 --> 00:34:18.192
That sounds really tough.

00:34:18.559 --> 00:34:21.195
But this year, all that hard work will...

00:34:21.195 --> 00:34:22.863
finally pay off.

00:34:22.863 --> 00:34:25.365

00:34:25.365 --> 00:34:28.569
Let's forget about
all that negative stuff.

00:34:30.571 --> 00:34:31.805
Thank you so much.

00:34:32.906 --> 00:34:35.275
I can't even pay for basic stuff anymore.

00:34:35.676 --> 00:34:37.811
Just surviving each day wears me out.

00:34:38.212 --> 00:34:41.882
What if I told you about
something you can do from home?

00:34:41.882 --> 00:34:43.283
I don't usually do this,

00:34:43.283 --> 00:34:45.953
but I want to help you...

00:34:45.953 --> 00:34:48.255
like a mother would.

00:34:48.956 --> 00:34:49.890
Really?

00:34:50.224 --> 00:34:52.159
What kind of work?

00:34:59.399 --> 00:35:01.835
Hi, Kim Mi Yang here.

00:35:07.941 --> 00:35:10.544
I've got a great opportunity for you.

00:35:21.522 --> 00:35:22.923

00:35:47.414 --> 00:35:48.315
Seriously.

00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:55.722

What do you think?

00:36:07.935 --> 00:36:09.303
Odd or even?

00:36:12.005 --> 00:36:13.340
What the hell?

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.908
You already blew through all that money?

00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:17.344
Time to put more money in.

00:36:18.145 --> 00:36:19.279
I told you to stop!

00:36:25.686 --> 00:36:26.420
What the fuck?

00:36:27.221 --> 00:36:28.121
Did you just hit me?

00:36:28.856 --> 00:36:29.690
You little shit.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:30.724
You're Hong Hwa?

00:36:42.803 --> 00:36:44.204
Hello?

00:36:44.204 --> 00:36:46.673
Are you Hong Hwa's mom?

00:36:47.074 --> 00:36:49.476
I'm Mr. Kim. Your boy owes me money.

00:36:51.411 --> 00:36:54.515
He borrowed money from you?

00:36:54.848 --> 00:36:57.184
Yeah, he did.

00:36:57.184 --> 00:36:59.486
Anyway, I'll get
a personal credit report done.

00:36:59.486 --> 00:37:00.587
It's 30 percent interest per year.

00:37:00.587 --> 00:37:02.890
That's the deal.
What are you going to do about it?

00:37:03.891 --> 00:37:04.791
How much does he owe you?

00:37:05.158 --> 00:37:06.627
Well...

00:37:06.627 --> 00:37:09.730
It's a bit over $20,000.
You got that kind of money?

00:37:10.197 --> 00:37:11.598
Two thousand?

00:37:15.035 --> 00:37:18.005
I don't have that kind of money.
I need some time.

00:37:18.005 --> 00:37:21.275
I can't deal with this right now.

00:37:21.275 --> 00:37:24.211
Maybe I should chop off his arm then?

00:37:24.878 --> 00:37:27.447
Forgive me.

00:37:27.981 --> 00:37:30.417
Don't hurt my son.

00:37:30.784 --> 00:37:33.120
What? You don't want that either?

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.323
So you can't pay...

00:37:36.323 --> 00:37:38.725
and you don't want me to hurt him?

00:37:38.725 --> 00:37:42.229
Then you work for me...

00:37:42.229 --> 00:37:43.330
to pay off his debt.

00:37:45.265 --> 00:37:46.166
Okay.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.107
Your mom...

00:37:54.908 --> 00:37:56.810
running phone scams
because of your debt...

00:37:57.911 --> 00:37:59.379
and she could go to prison.

00:38:01.782 --> 00:38:03.917
She's looking at two years in jail.

00:38:11.325 --> 00:38:13.427
You don't want your mom in prison?

00:38:16.763 --> 00:38:18.332
Then call them and do what I say.

I'm really sorry.

What did you do to him?

00:41:33.994 --> 00:41:36.063
You used my mom.

00:41:36.697 --> 00:41:38.665
Now I use your kid.

00:41:38.665 --> 00:41:40.667
You psycho jerk.

00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:42.703
You hurt him,

00:41:42.703 --> 00:41:44.638
you're dead.

00:41:44.638 --> 00:41:45.839
So...

00:41:46.573 --> 00:41:48.942
You'd better answer me
before something happens to him.

00:42:06.059 --> 00:42:06.860
Hello?

00:42:07.194 --> 00:42:09.096
I want to report someone
collecting money for phone scammers.

00:42:11.732 --> 00:42:12.599
Say it.

00:42:13.901 --> 00:42:14.801
Who is it?

00:42:24.111 --> 00:42:24.978
You don't want to?

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.948
Then never mind.

00:42:30.117 --> 00:42:32.186
I don't care if your son's life
goes down the drain.

00:42:33.387 --> 00:42:34.321
Mr. Kim.

00:42:37.791 --> 00:42:38.692
Mr. Kim?

00:42:39.793 --> 00:42:42.396
He sends kids to the call centers.

00:42:43.964 --> 00:42:45.432
The only way to the boss

00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:47.601
is through Mr. Kim.

00:43:03.584 --> 00:43:06.086
Sorry, I'm just doing what they told me.

00:43:10.123 --> 00:43:11.592
The transaction has been canceled.

00:43:11.592 --> 00:43:13.794
Please select the transaction you want.

00:43:17.264 --> 00:43:19.233
They said they'd kill my son...

00:43:20.234 --> 00:43:22.569
if I didn't help them.

00:43:23.203 --> 00:43:26.874
What mother wouldn't do anything
to save her child?

00:43:34.147 --> 00:43:35.015
Want to take them down?

00:43:37.918 --> 00:43:40.654
Once we get this Mr. Kim guy,

00:43:40.654 --> 00:43:41.955
it's finished.

00:43:44.625 --> 00:43:45.626
I'll handle it.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.195
Tell me where he is.

00:43:49.696 --> 00:43:51.932
It won't be easy,

00:43:54.635 --> 00:43:56.036
whether it's going to China

00:43:58.238 --> 00:43:59.573
or taking him out.

00:44:06.446 --> 00:44:09.516
(Seongan Police made victims
suffer all over again.)

00:44:09.516 --> 00:44:11.318
(Manager A phishing case,
was there outside pressure?)

00:44:11.718 --> 00:44:12.886
(Seongan Police Agency)

00:44:12.886 --> 00:44:14.888
(Seongan Police's suspected of colluding
with Team Leader Park Min Su's gang.)

00:44:15.989 --> 00:44:17.658
(No wonder nobody trust the cops.)

00:44:17.658 --> 00:44:19.359
(Once it starts rotting inside,
there's no stopping it.)

00:44:19.359 --> 00:44:20.894
(Seongan Police is seriously sketchy.)

00:44:23.897 --> 00:44:25.098
Who leaked this?

00:44:25.832 --> 00:44:29.069
Who leaked this case to outsiders?

00:44:29.336 --> 00:44:32.539
We tried to pass this off,
but now it's all on us.

00:44:33.106 --> 00:44:35.042
What about the damage
to our agency's reputation?

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:37.744
Since it's come to this,

00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:40.914
you got one month.

00:44:40.914 --> 00:44:43.417
Get those Ilseong bastards,
whatever it takes.

00:44:44.718 --> 00:44:46.553
Thank you for the tip.

00:44:47.321 --> 00:44:48.589
Seongan Police Agency.

00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:50.490
Allegations of outside pressure on
the investigation into the Ilseong clan

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:53.026
the country's top financial scam group.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.395
That's a killer headline.

00:44:56.129 --> 00:44:59.132
Yes, you could call it tentpole-level.

00:44:59.132 --> 00:45:02.803
Dig deeper and we might have
a major story.

00:45:04.571 --> 00:45:06.573
Are you sure about this?

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.610
If they find out who you are,

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.712
Then I'll be famous. No big deal.

00:45:12.346 --> 00:45:14.948
When it happens, people would cheer for me
even if I just went to the bathroom.

00:45:16.517 --> 00:45:17.684
I'll be in touch.

00:45:33.033 --> 00:45:33.867
So Min.

00:45:34.535 --> 00:45:35.736
I'll be on my way now.

00:45:37.738 --> 00:45:38.872
There's only one person

00:45:38.872 --> 00:45:41.575
Ma Seok Gu fears in Ilseong.

00:45:42.176 --> 00:45:43.110
Who's that?

00:45:44.378 --> 00:45:45.679
Someone named Park Gye Soon.

00:45:46.914 --> 00:45:48.282
- Park Gye Soon?
- Yeah.

00:45:49.416 --> 00:45:51.618
She's the only one
who can control Ma Seok Gu,

00:45:51.618 --> 00:45:53.387
the head of the Ilseong clan.

00:46:04.298 --> 00:46:05.432
But right now,

00:46:06.533 --> 00:46:07.901
she's missing.

00:46:08.335 --> 00:46:09.369
Nobody knows where she is.

00:46:11.738 --> 00:46:13.707
You're saying we pretend to be her
to infiltrate the Ilseong clan?

00:46:14.174 --> 00:46:15.008
Can that even work?

00:46:15.742 --> 00:46:18.478
It's all about technology and smarts now.

00:46:18.846 --> 00:46:21.181
They played us,

00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:23.517
so we play them back.

00:46:24.318 --> 00:46:25.619
since we're already set on
getting revenge.

00:46:26.453 --> 00:46:28.188
But how would that even work?

00:46:28.655 --> 00:46:29.990
Deepfake technology.

00:46:32.626 --> 00:46:34.228
Meet my informant.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:38.632
That's one hell of a name.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.301
Want to test it out on Mr. Kim?

00:46:42.302 --> 00:46:43.270
Test what?

00:46:43.937 --> 00:46:45.205
Curious what the test is?

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.375
If you want to know, pay a dime.

00:46:55.516 --> 00:46:58.151
I'm so fucking fed up.

00:46:58.785 --> 00:47:00.220
How long do I have...

00:47:11.532 --> 00:47:13.267
to do this shit?

00:47:14.835 --> 00:47:17.638
Fuck this. I'm done.

00:47:21.508 --> 00:47:22.743
Keep this up...

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:24.912
and I'll lose my mind.

00:47:31.084 --> 00:47:31.818
What the hell?

00:47:32.019 --> 00:47:32.853
(Hi.)

00:47:32.853 --> 00:47:34.021
Who the hell is this?

00:47:35.789 --> 00:47:37.424
Who are you?

00:47:38.091 --> 00:47:39.326
(Who could it be?)

00:47:39.326 --> 00:47:40.160
What?

00:47:41.328 --> 00:47:43.330
Who are you?

00:47:43.997 --> 00:47:45.499
(If you want to know, pay a dime.)

00:47:45.732 --> 00:47:47.201
Son of a bitch.

00:47:47.868 --> 00:47:49.670
(You'll be shocked if you find out who.)

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:52.673
What kind of nutjob is this now?

00:47:53.774 --> 00:47:54.641
What the hell?

00:47:54.942 --> 00:47:57.778
It must be some dumbass.
I'll just pick it up.

00:48:01.381 --> 00:48:02.883
How have you been?

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:04.651
It's

00:48:05.452 --> 00:48:06.553
Park Gye Soon.

00:48:07.154 --> 00:48:08.222
You...

00:48:10.858 --> 00:48:11.725
How...

00:48:12.359 --> 00:48:13.994
Since I pissed off that cunning bastard,

00:48:14.294 --> 00:48:15.662
I've been living a new life.

00:48:17.364 --> 00:48:19.366
Aren't you happy to see me?

00:48:54.535 --> 00:48:56.870
(No Mercy)

00:48:57.104 --> 00:48:58.038
Who the fuck are you?

00:48:58.672 --> 00:48:59.706
I said, who are you?

00:48:59.706 --> 00:49:01.074
I've got an informant,

00:49:01.074 --> 00:49:03.076
someone using you to get Ma Seok Gu.

00:49:03.844 --> 00:49:05.512
I need to get on that boat.

00:49:05.512 --> 00:49:07.748
If you're going to call the cops...

00:49:07.748 --> 00:49:10.117
Don't worry. Just stick with the plan.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:12.252
This works with only the copy,

00:49:12.252 --> 00:49:13.587
no hacking app, no password needed.

00:49:13.587 --> 00:49:15.422
This is how you do it, idiots!

00:49:15.422 --> 00:49:16.957
Wi Chang Ok?

00:49:16.957 --> 00:49:18.425
You were under Park Gye Soon?

00:49:18.425 --> 00:49:20.694
What do you want from me?

00:49:20.928 --> 00:49:23.597
Get me in with your guys
and send me to China.

00:49:23.597 --> 00:49:24.865
You run the investigation,

00:49:24.865 --> 00:49:25.699
but...

00:49:26.033 --> 00:49:27.501
do it my way, got it?

00:49:27.501 --> 00:49:29.436
Are you threatening me?

00:49:29.436 --> 00:49:31.972
That’s not how you treat a VIP.

00:49:31.972 --> 00:49:33.907
It must’ve been rough
coming all the way here.

00:49:35.045 --> 00:49:37.045
