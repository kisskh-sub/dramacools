00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.466
Arisu!

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.433
Arisu!

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.738
Arisu!

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.471
Aguni.

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:40.725
Hey, newbie.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.105
You're alive.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:48.399
Not by choice.

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:52.112
Saw Niragi out there.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.866
So he survived too, huh?

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:03.706
And what about the others?

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.545
We broke off from Ann and Chishiya.

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:12.423
Kuina went to track them down.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.344
Tatta didn't make it out.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.684
And me, I'm… going to look for Usagi.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:25.812
I see.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:30.525
Where are you going?

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:34.821
I'm taking down the King of Spades.
We could use a hand.

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:36.906
How are you gonna do that?

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.576
He's just a man, isn't he?

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:41.828
All men have weaknesses.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.539
He's too strong.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:47.333
Yeah.

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:49.711
So it's perfect for me.

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:53.840
One last battlefield
for those of us looking to die.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:55.884
A last battlefield?

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.219
I should've died in the fire at the Beach.

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:01.389
I've got nowhere to go…

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.433
and nowhere to be.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.939
Well, I don't have a death wish yet.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.948
Arisu, I have to ask.

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:22.869
What are you living for, anyway?

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.538
What's driving you, Arisu?

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.417
Do you really wanna go back to our world?

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.669
Or are you just running after a girl?

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.214
Aguni.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.927
I don't need a reason to live.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.893
My purpose doesn't make a difference.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.480
Even if it's gone…

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:55.652
Aguni, I need to keep living.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.407
That's a weak existence.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.869
Humans wanna live, don't they?

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:08.456
I guess.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.251
I'm jealous, Arisu.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:40.989
- Wait a sec.
- Wow!

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.366
- Your nails are so cute.
- Adorable!

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.575
Where'd you get them done?

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.912
- This place really close to the station.
- Yo, invite them!

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.080
- No, you!
- Incoming.

00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:50.123
Hey, hey, hey.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.293
Barbecue on Sunday. Wanna come?

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.336
- Barbecue!
- Barbecue?

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.588
- You know it!
- Meat on the grill, ladies!

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.133
We need memories
of our last high school summer.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.551
- Yeah!
- We can camp by the river.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:02.802
- I'm sorry.
- What do you say?

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.930
That's the anniversary
of my mother's death.

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.223
Oh. Brutal.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.767
We didn't know. Our bad.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.730
Yeah, that's because no one knows.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.940
Like I want people to hear that bitch died

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:19.360
while on a trip with someone
she was cheating with.

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:23.531
Anyway, who the hell would wanna grill
meat outside when it's this fucking hot?

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:25.742
- Wow, that was harsh.
- Seriously?

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.785
They just want us to grill their meat.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.997
You think you got a shot with us?
What are you, idiots?

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.499
Aw, hey, I kinda feel bad.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.209
- Was that mean?
- You're terrible.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:36.753
Have fun with your meat!

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.841
What? Don't you need
to go to archery club today?

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:43.926
No, I don't feel like it.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.263
Oh, so apparently,
Meg broke up with her boyfriend.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.933
You're kidding. With Odaken?
They were, like, so in love.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.226
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.978
Not so much in love.

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:56.272
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.900
- Do you know something?
- What are you talking about?

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.444
He said he was over it.

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.821
And then he said he was into me!

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.742
Wait, did you sleep with Odaken?

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:10.161
- So what? He came on to me first.
- Please!

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:12.580
- Insane.
- You knew what you were doing.

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:17.126
God, you really won't let anything
stand between you and a guy.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:19.670
Right? She can't help herself!

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.173
I can't compete with this--

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.386
Huh?

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.044
PLAYERS, PLEASE GATHER
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:04.549
ONE PER PERSON

00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:40.168
{\an8}PLEASE WAIT FOR THE GAME TO BEGIN
CURRENT TOTAL: 17 PARTICIPANTS

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.919
Game? What is this?

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.174
What's happening?

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.093
Where did everyone go?

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.473
You wanna survive, girl?

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:57.185
Then you're gonna have to beat the game.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.775
Difficulty, Seven of Spades.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.112
Game, Boiling Death.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.656
Rules. Escape.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:15.161
The game ends
when the arena fully collapses.

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:22.543
Fully collapses?

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.848
What's… What's going on?

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:39.810
Oh! What…

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:45.191
This can't be happening.
I can't… I'm out of here!

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:47.151
I don't wanna play!

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:58.329
Come on, run!

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:18.367
It's hot! It's hot!

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.213
I gotta pull it out.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.380
You can do it!

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:17.611
I know that I wasn't the best person
before. I know!

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:23.117
Someone sent me to this nightmare
because I wasn't good?

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:27.747
I don't deserve
to die like this!

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:32.460
It's all that bitch's fault…

00:12:59.653 --> 00:13:01.489
This isn't who you are.

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:11.165
Takeru.

00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:28.724
Why are you here?

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.853
You think working with them will help you?

00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:39.693
You even bothered to save Arisu.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.113
Maybe you've got death on your mind?

00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:47.243
You're trying to make up for all those
people you killed

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.953
back at the Beach, aren't you?

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:55.543
The King of Spades isn't like you or me.
He's a mighty warrior.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.505
You don't deserve to die like a hero.

00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:09.390
You wanna die so damn bad?

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.186
You should put a bullet
through your skull.

00:14:33.414 --> 00:14:34.582
Aguni.

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.251
We have to stop this.

00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:40.963
No more innocent people have to die.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.382
Too many have already.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.012
All right, I get it.

00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:50.764
Please just go now.

00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:34.558
Are you awake?

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:43.984
Hey, are you a virgin or what?

00:15:44.568 --> 00:15:45.486
No!

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.250
All right…

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:03.504
Um, which way to the city?

00:16:04.004 --> 00:16:06.423
Huh? You're leaving already?

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:08.342
I'm looking for someone.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.054
Like a girl someone, right?

00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:13.847
Usagi?

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.933
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

00:16:17.184 --> 00:16:19.311
Hmm!

00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:26.735
Do you think I'm cuter than her?

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:28.487
What?

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.075
That sounds like a yes.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:36.245
- No.
- Are you blushing?

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:37.413
No, I'm not.

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:48.674
You seem nice enough.

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:52.094
- Huh?
- And you're pretty cute too…

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.138
- All right, let's do it.
- Whoa, hang on! Hey!

00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:58.892
We have to live in a world where we don't
know if we'll survive the day, you know?

00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:01.478
- And besides, it's been so long…
- Get off me !

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:02.479
- Gah!
- Come on!

00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:08.944
Uh…

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.613
This… This isn't what it looks like.
It's nothing!

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.907
Don't look at me like that! You…

00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:16.076
You already said no, so…

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:18.537
We're on the move. Get up.

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:23.083
What? I'm not going with you.
I'm going to look for Usagi.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:25.586
You should be worried
about yourself right now.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:30.382
As soon as he gets us in his sights,
he's gonna attack.

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:32.843
He might even be tracking us here already.

00:17:33.343 --> 00:17:34.178
I don't know.

00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:36.847
But we definitely have to keep moving.

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:40.184
We'll lead him up
into the mountains somewhere.

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:41.518
Then we'll strike.

00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:45.731
More people means more chances. Here.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:49.902
Hey, wait!

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.239
Oh my God. He's so cool.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.705
The King of Spades
is always on the move,

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:03.791
looking for more players to kill.

00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:07.795
But it's not random, right?
It feels targeted.

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:09.838
I bet he's keeping tabs on us.

00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:12.841
We'll find a good spot to ambush him.

00:18:19.139 --> 00:18:21.266
The King of Spades is never going to stop.

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:23.977
He's already killed so many.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.524
I figured we'd be safe
if we stayed out here in the woods,

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:31.318
but that didn't stop him.

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:38.992
The compass is saying
we should be near Kichijoji Station.

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:40.994
You sure?

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.528
Killed himself
before his visa could run out.

00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:19.324
That son of a bitch didn't even fight.
He just took the coward's way out.

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:22.619
In a world like this,
can you really blame him?

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.583
All I know is I'll never make that choice.

00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:32.212
You ever lose someone you were close to
in a game?

00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:36.216
No, I haven't.

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:39.761
What I lost…

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:44.391
was an important piece of who I was.

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:39.655
Akane.

00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:47.537
Mom?

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.960
What the hell are you doing here?

00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.430
Akane!

00:21:17.484 --> 00:21:18.735
Come to me.

00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:30.580
Can I trust you, Mom? Huh?

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:03.905
It's not hot.

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:15.083
I was the only survivor
of my first game.

00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:22.007
My mom, that cheating bitch,
her ghost saved my life.

00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:48.700
The color's getting weird.

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:53.121
I'm gonna die.

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:54.664
It's gonna kill me.

00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:59.544
That is some advanced gangrene.

00:23:08.428 --> 00:23:10.430
That leg has to go.

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:12.265
At least, if you wanna survive.

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:15.143
You a doctor?

00:23:16.853 --> 00:23:17.979
Can you help me, then?

00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:20.440
What, help you for free?

00:23:20.524 --> 00:23:23.151
Do you want money? How can I pay?

00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:26.446
Hah! Adorable.

00:23:27.197 --> 00:23:29.908
Like I have any use for money here.

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.035
Come on.

00:23:47.634 --> 00:23:48.844
Okay, then…

00:23:53.723 --> 00:23:55.642
Just do something for my leg!

00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:04.109
Aah!

00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:19.207
I owe a debt
to the me who survived that day.

00:24:20.834 --> 00:24:22.544
I'm here because of what she did.

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.505
So I'll survive, no matter what the cost.

00:24:27.507 --> 00:24:29.551
I'm never gonna take the easy way out.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.888
I have to keep living.

00:26:08.316 --> 00:26:10.277
We already looked. There's nothing.

00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:24.791
If you want, help yourself.

00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:34.801
Thank you.

00:26:37.887 --> 00:26:38.888
He's yours?

00:26:42.642 --> 00:26:45.562
I found him all alone
while I was playing tag.

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:49.232
And your parents?

00:26:57.699 --> 00:26:59.242
I think they might be dead.

00:27:00.201 --> 00:27:02.787
He doesn't have much time
left on his visa.

00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:04.789
I couldn't leave him alone.

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.584
In that case,

00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:10.879
even if he makes it back to our world,

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.590
it'll be hard.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.678
His life won't be easy.

00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:22.557
But

00:27:23.516 --> 00:27:29.272
I have to believe that his parents want
their son to live and make it back safe.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.194
They must want him
to find happiness there.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.946
I know it.

00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:01.680
Yuzuha.

00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:03.723
Yeah?

00:28:03.807 --> 00:28:06.226
If something happens and I disappear,

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:09.521
promise you won't be sad.

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.148
What are you saying?

00:28:12.232 --> 00:28:13.858
It's what I want.

00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:16.403
It's my dream to die in the mountains.

00:28:17.153 --> 00:28:18.655
Don't say that.

00:28:20.323 --> 00:28:22.242
I don't wanna die like…

00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:25.578
…an old man in the hospital.

00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:32.502
Ah, if the mountains kill me,

00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:35.714
then that's just proof I lived well.

00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:39.300
And so if that happened,

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:42.512
I want you to live
as full a life as possible.

00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:43.847
To go on.

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:47.035
We must be around Yokohama right now.

00:30:06.262 --> 00:30:08.473
Is this forest ever going to end?

00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:04.445
We'll lure him here.

00:31:05.738 --> 00:31:06.573
Here?

00:31:07.657 --> 00:31:08.741
This is a cliff.

00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:11.119
Nobody asked you.

00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:21.588
A smoke bomb?

00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:23.882
The traps warn us of incoming attacks.

00:31:24.674 --> 00:31:26.718
We'll be alerted by them, even at night.

00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:29.679
It's too bad we don't have any grenades.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.181
Set up all the wires we have.

00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:34.809
Why just use wire?

00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:38.104
A trap doesn't have to be real
to be effective.

00:31:38.187 --> 00:31:41.149
As long as it makes the enemy go
where you want them to go.

00:31:42.817 --> 00:31:43.902
You know a lot.

00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:46.404
- Sure do.
- I taught her.

00:31:47.864 --> 00:31:49.532
You keep watch at the tent.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.646
Was I bait for you?

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.273
You have a talent for it.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.944
He invincible?

00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:33.654
It's a bulletproof vest.

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:35.907
My guess is he's a mercenary.

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:38.659
We'll cover each other
while we lead him to the cliff.

00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:41.329
Go.

00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:27.875
Arisu! Run!

00:35:35.216 --> 00:35:36.384
Arisu!

00:36:18.217 --> 00:36:19.260
Aguni!

00:38:39.525 --> 00:38:40.609
Usagi!

00:38:48.868 --> 00:38:49.994
Ah!

00:38:55.124 --> 00:38:56.375
I'm sorry.

00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:05.403
- That's it!
- Yeah! We did it!

00:40:06.654 --> 00:40:08.447
All right!

00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:10.825
- All right! We did it!
- Yeah!

00:40:10.908 --> 00:40:13.619
Yeah! Yeah!

00:40:15.121 --> 00:40:15.955
We won this!

00:40:16.038 --> 00:40:17.206
Run!

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:19.542
- We got this!
- I'm done!

00:40:19.708 --> 00:40:21.252
- I can't do it.
- Keep going!

00:40:21.335 --> 00:40:22.878
Usagi!

00:40:27.299 --> 00:40:28.717
Usagi!

00:40:28.801 --> 00:40:30.553
- Keep moving.
- Yeah!

00:40:49.196 --> 00:40:50.906
No blaze of glory for me…

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.463
Go.

00:41:12.094 --> 00:41:13.596
Get outta here!

00:41:17.266 --> 00:41:18.517
Aguni?

00:41:35.367 --> 00:41:37.536
You're all right!

00:42:54.613 --> 00:42:56.949
Difficulty, Jack of Spades.

00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:41.410
I gotta hand it
to these face card games.

00:43:41.493 --> 00:43:43.287
They're not messing around.

00:43:45.247 --> 00:43:47.166
Ow, that's not good.

00:44:15.944 --> 00:44:17.780
They won't beat me.

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:21.844
This isn't the world I know.

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:56.170
I'm not going.

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:01.675
Do you want to die?

00:46:05.679 --> 00:46:06.680
No?

00:46:07.347 --> 00:46:09.099
Then let's win it together.

00:46:10.726 --> 00:46:12.770
But what's going to happen to us?

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.443
If we win…

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.946
we get to go back home.

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:28.243
They're not there anymore.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.997
Mom and Dad are both gone.

00:46:37.044 --> 00:46:38.086
I get it.

00:46:39.546 --> 00:46:42.966
What is it that you think your parents
would want you to do, Kota?

00:46:46.845 --> 00:46:48.639
They'd want me to come home.

00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:52.100
Then let's go.

00:47:42.484 --> 00:47:43.986
And how old are you, kid?

00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:45.904
I'm ten.

00:47:48.073 --> 00:47:49.241
You're a good kid.

00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:57.124
This is a Spade game,
and you can't have a kid here.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.502
If he weighs us down,
I'll do what I have to.

00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:03.255
So don't blame me.

00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:10.846
Usagi has what it takes to win.

00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:19.229
Arisu.

00:48:19.938 --> 00:48:21.023
Usagi.

00:48:28.488 --> 00:48:30.324
I knew you'd still be alive.

00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:32.910
Me too.

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:36.413
But how did you know I'd be here?

00:48:37.664 --> 00:48:39.625
I knew you'd try a physical game.

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:43.879
All that's left is the Queen of Spades
and the King.

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:17.955
And this is Kota.

00:49:18.664 --> 00:49:20.374
His visa runs out today.

00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:22.584
So you brought him here?

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:27.130
I figured that
I could help him in a Spade game.

00:49:31.176 --> 00:49:32.928
What's going on?

00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:37.391
Game, Checkmate.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.309
Checkmate?

00:49:41.019 --> 00:49:45.941
Today, the Queen Team will face off
against you, the Challenger Team.

00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:49.820
Welcome, Challenger Team.

00:49:49.903 --> 00:49:53.073
Welcome to the arena
of beautiful bodies in motion.

00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:56.535
I am the Queen of Spades.

00:49:57.619 --> 00:50:01.289
The Queen Team is made up of four members,
including myself.

00:50:01.373 --> 00:50:04.292
Your Challenger Team has 16 members.

00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:06.420
Do you think they're citizens as well?

00:50:07.462 --> 00:50:09.047
Each team will have a King.

00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:10.757
Don't worry, I'll choose.

00:50:11.591 --> 00:50:13.260
The Queen Team's King

00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:15.429
is me.

00:50:16.596 --> 00:50:19.850
Now, I'm looking
for a good Challenger King.

00:50:21.059 --> 00:50:22.394
Who's it gonna be?

00:50:25.439 --> 00:50:26.440
Oh.

00:50:28.275 --> 00:50:29.568
I choose him.

00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:50.547
Game rules.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.970
The teams will alternate taking turns
for a total of 16 rounds.

00:50:57.054 --> 00:50:58.972
During the Queen Team's turn,

00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:03.894
the Queen Team's players
will chase the Challenger Team's players.

00:51:03.977 --> 00:51:07.189
If the button on a player's back
is pressed,

00:51:07.272 --> 00:51:10.067
the button's light
will turn from blue to red,

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:11.735
the Queen Team's color.

00:51:12.694 --> 00:51:17.324
That player may not move
for the remainder of that round.

00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:19.034
Starting on the following round,

00:51:19.117 --> 00:51:23.121
that player will now be considered
a member of the Queen Team.

00:51:23.955 --> 00:51:28.001
The King, however,
is not allowed to change teams.

00:51:29.795 --> 00:51:33.965
The opposite will occur
during the Challenger Team's turns.

00:51:34.049 --> 00:51:37.469
Each turn will last no more
than five minutes.

00:51:37.552 --> 00:51:41.556
After the end of 16 rounds
of alternating turns,

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.559
the team with the most members wins.

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:48.188
The members of the losing team,
including the King,

00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:50.023
will all die.

00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:52.317
What the hell is this?

00:51:53.693 --> 00:51:54.736
It seems like

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:57.405
chess, or shogi, more like.

00:51:57.989 --> 00:52:01.743
If you get tagged when they push your
button, you're captured by the enemy team.

00:52:02.744 --> 00:52:05.831
You switch sides, you fight for them now.

00:52:05.914 --> 00:52:07.582
That's how it works.

00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:13.171
Please equip your vests,
with the buttons facing the back.

00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:26.810
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- How do you do this?

00:52:28.353 --> 00:52:30.021
Can I see yours?

00:52:34.776 --> 00:52:38.155
Round one.
Queen Team's turn begins.

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:41.032
The turn will last five minutes.

00:52:41.616 --> 00:52:43.410
Game start.

00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:46.913
Huh?

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:53.962
They're coming.
They're coming. They're coming!

00:52:55.463 --> 00:52:56.882
They're coming for us!

00:52:57.841 --> 00:52:59.926
They'll get us all if we stay together!
Let's split up!

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.052
- Yeah!
- Okay? Let's go!

00:53:01.136 --> 00:53:02.179
- Come on!
- Move!

00:53:02.262 --> 00:53:03.930
- We can't stay together!
- Hurry!

00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:04.848
- Hide!
- This way!

00:53:04.931 --> 00:53:05.891
- Go!
- Go, go!

00:53:11.646 --> 00:53:12.647
We'll keep you safe.

00:53:13.231 --> 00:53:14.858
Just stay right here, okay?

00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:18.236
- Okay.
- Usagi, come on.

00:53:30.498 --> 00:53:32.792
Go, go! Hurry! Go, go!

00:53:34.002 --> 00:53:35.003
Go!

00:53:35.086 --> 00:53:37.297
- No, they're here!
- Go back, go back! Run!

00:53:37.881 --> 00:53:39.257
Left! This way!

00:53:41.134 --> 00:53:43.720
- Keep running! They're here!
- Run, run, run!

00:53:43.803 --> 00:53:45.555
No, out of the way! Out of the way!

00:53:57.442 --> 00:53:59.152
Oh no!

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:16.086
Pushing the button gives you
a little shock. I should have said.

00:54:16.169 --> 00:54:19.339
But don't worry,
you're gonna be my pawn next turn.

00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:27.055
- Where?
- They went that way.

00:54:27.722 --> 00:54:30.058
Up! There's one up!

00:54:31.142 --> 00:54:32.185
Run!

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:08.763
The first turn
is ending in ten seconds.

00:55:08.847 --> 00:55:11.891
Ten, nine, eight,

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:14.144
- seven, six…
- This is bad.

00:55:14.227 --> 00:55:15.687
- …five…
- Look at all the red.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.731
- …four, three…
- But at least her turn is up.

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:19.065
…two, one.

00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:22.485
Starting the Challengers' turn.

00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:27.282
The turn will last five minutes.

00:55:27.782 --> 00:55:28.783
Turn start.

00:55:28.867 --> 00:55:31.286
Let's get back the ones we lost.

00:55:31.369 --> 00:55:34.622
Besides, it's not like the new pawns
are gonna wanna work for her.

00:55:34.706 --> 00:55:36.124
They'll wanna rejoin us, right?

00:55:36.207 --> 00:55:38.585
- Right.
- Yeah. Okay. Let's go!

00:55:42.756 --> 00:55:44.799
Hey! Hey! Over here!

00:55:44.883 --> 00:55:45.967
Up here! Up here!

00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:48.928
Hey! Come on! Get up here. Help! Help!

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:50.138
You gotta tag me back!

00:55:50.722 --> 00:55:52.015
- Okay, hang on!
- Hurry!

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:54.726
- Don't move!
- Hurry up! Hurry!

00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:02.734
Up here!

00:56:03.568 --> 00:56:05.403
Huh? Whoa!

00:56:06.071 --> 00:56:07.072
Here, thanks!

00:56:20.335 --> 00:56:21.920
What's she doing to him?

00:56:22.003 --> 00:56:23.880
She's stopping him from tagging.

00:56:23.963 --> 00:56:27.258
Of course. The rules
didn't mention anything about that.

00:56:28.134 --> 00:56:30.470
Round three.

00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:33.098
Queen Team's turn begins.

00:56:33.807 --> 00:56:36.267
The turn will last five minutes.

00:56:36.351 --> 00:56:38.144
Turn start.

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:39.896
We're gonna have to split up.

00:56:39.979 --> 00:56:41.940
Get each player back one by one.

00:56:42.023 --> 00:56:44.651
If we split up,
maybe we won't find each other again.

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.027
I'm not losing you.

00:56:51.991 --> 00:56:54.411
After each turn,
there's a siren that goes off.

00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:55.495
Yeah…

00:56:58.957 --> 00:57:02.544
When it does, come to this side.
We'll be able to check on each other.

00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:04.421
Right. Got it.

00:57:29.529 --> 00:57:30.947
No! Please!

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:33.283
Stay back! Stop!

00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:44.252
You wanna live or not?

00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:46.796
I wanna live.

00:57:47.547 --> 00:57:50.008
Then you're gonna have to play on my team.

00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:54.053
Turn five.
One minute remaining.

00:58:03.688 --> 00:58:04.898
No, stop!

00:58:07.942 --> 00:58:10.361
You-- you get back here! Stop running!

00:58:10.445 --> 00:58:11.529
Damn it!

00:58:14.574 --> 00:58:15.492
That's it…

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:53.321
Ah! Got you! Yes!

00:58:58.451 --> 00:59:02.956
Round ten.
Challenger Team's turn begins.

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:05.375
The turn will last five minutes.

00:59:05.458 --> 00:59:07.252
Turn start.

00:59:07.835 --> 00:59:09.003
Let me help you!

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.718
Wait! Wait. Hang on!

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.694
Round 11.

00:59:32.777 --> 00:59:35.238
Queen Team's turn begins.

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:37.907
The turn will last five minutes.

00:59:37.991 --> 00:59:39.909
Turn start.

00:59:39.993 --> 00:59:41.661
- You okay?
- Okay!

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.959
- Go, run!
- Hurry up! It'll be the next turn soon!

00:59:48.042 --> 00:59:50.461
- Got you! Hah! Loser!
- Oh, no!

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:15.278
Join us on the Queen's Team.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:18.072
What? What do you mean?

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:23.328
If you stay in this arena,
you don't have to play the other games.

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:26.748
King of Spades can't kill you either,
if you're in here.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.625
That's not bad, huh?

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.753
Wait, you're players too?

01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:34.213
- Just players like us?
- Sure we are.

01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:37.675
We played this game last time
and won by sticking with the Queen.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.471
She's strong, man. She never loses.

01:00:41.554 --> 01:00:43.890
Plus if we win, we get to stay right here.

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:48.603
So if the Queen never loses,
then her team gets to keep playing.

01:00:48.686 --> 01:00:49.562
You get it?

01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:54.275
The Queen's team gets to survive
in this place as long as they want.

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:58.237
Pretty cool, wouldn't you say, man?

01:01:17.423 --> 01:01:19.801
- Found anyone else?
- No, not yet.

01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:21.386
Let's look upstairs.

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:23.429
Oh, shit.

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:31.813
It's not so bad, right?

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:34.941
At least we don't have to die
in some other game.

01:01:36.067 --> 01:01:37.151
Yeah.

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:41.406
Yeah, boys!
It's easy if we all work together now!

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:43.991
Protect the Queen
and protect your own lives, all right?

01:01:44.992 --> 01:01:46.077
Yeah.

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:53.501
I feel bad for the kid.

01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:55.420
But it's him or us, right?

01:01:56.629 --> 01:02:00.049
Exactly. There's nothing
we can do about it now.

01:02:01.926 --> 01:02:04.053
There's only three of them left.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.932
Victory is in sight.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:11.144
And best of all, none of you have to die.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.398
- Oh!
- But listen.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.860
I wanna get one more of them.

01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:20.236
One more? Which one?

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:23.114
The guy who knew the girl and the kid.

01:02:24.198 --> 01:02:26.784
Oh yeah. Arisu or something.

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:29.829
Yeah, exactly.

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:36.502
I want him.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:44.218
Two more people
until checkmate. Turn 13.

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.554
Starting Queen's turn.

01:02:46.637 --> 01:02:49.015
The turn will last five minutes.

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:50.933
Turn, start.

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:55.855
There he is!

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:17.752
Go, run!

01:03:17.835 --> 01:03:19.045
She's after you.

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:20.838
What?
