WEBVTT

00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:01.625
(10 days until the 1st competition)

00:00:01.925 --> 00:00:04.495
(In Phuket, Thailand, they experienced...)

00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:05.835
During this Phuket trip...

00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:08.135
(the Phuket Boot Camp.)

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:10.905
(To bring up their stamina,)

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.105
(they had the toughest training.)

00:00:15.205 --> 00:00:17.345
(What was their next training?)

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.345
(Full sparring)

00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:21.544
(Their opponents were...)

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:22.744
(foreign boxers.)

00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:25.915
(Ireland, Australia, UK, Thailand)

00:00:26.555 --> 00:00:29.525
(The last sparring before the first competition)

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:30.895
You're doing great!

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:34.695
(A slugfest kicked off.)

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:36.924
(Their plane tickets weren't wasted...)

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:39.265
(because the sparring was fierce.)

00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:42.605
(What's the remaining schedule of the Phuket Boot Camp?)

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:46.675
(Phuket Boot Camp, Day 2)

00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:50.245
(What's Iron Girls' 1st schedule on their 2nd day in Phuket?)

00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:52.145
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:54.415
(Singing a tune)

00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:58.285
(There's excitement in their voices.)

00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:00.754
Gosh, we're in Phuket.

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:02.585
Gosh. Finally.

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:04.925
Finally, I feel like I'm in Thailand.

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.525
Phuket's morning.

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:08.324
(Let's enjoy this place until the afternoon training.)

00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:09.764
I love it.

00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:11.534
I'm so happy.

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:13.365
This is incredible.

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:16.135
I want to live in a house like this.

00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:19.375
Isn't it our first time playing in a swimming pool?

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:21.144
It's our first time playing, period.

00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:22.944
- I know. - When we trained for a triathlon,

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:24.845
we never visited a swimming pool.

00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:26.345
It'll be fun.

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:29.014
I'll see Uie swim.

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:31.084
- Me? What should I do? - I've never seen it.

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:32.184
You've never seen it, right?

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:33.355
Shall I put on a wetsuit?

00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:34.925
Shall I show you?

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:36.985
Shall we go to the sea? Shall I put on a wetsuit?

00:01:37.695 --> 00:01:40.495
One, two, three, four.

00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:43.825
Hold the shoulder next to you and stretch the right thigh.

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:45.195
Like this?

00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:47.505
One, two, three...

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:49.165
Seven, eight.

00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:51.635
- My hamstrings are about to snap. - Stretch those muscles.

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:54.074
(Screaming)

00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:56.305
We can't sit down. We can't sit down now.

00:01:57.645 --> 00:01:58.875
We really can't sit down.

00:01:59.545 --> 00:02:00.545
(Screaming)

00:02:00.546 --> 00:02:01.644
We want to swim...

00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:03.214
in a pretty swimming pool this way.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:04.314
(The aftereffect of yesterday's intense training)

00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:06.185
Had I known about this, I would've put on a wetsuit.

00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:07.925
(Screaming)

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:09.025
(Sighing)

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:10.895
- I can't do it. - I can't do it.

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:12.594
Can we enter the pool now?

00:02:12.595 --> 00:02:13.695
(After warming up, they enjoy their free time.)

00:02:14.155 --> 00:02:15.525
- Step on me. - Okay.

00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:17.165
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:24.205
(They submerge themselves for a mysterious reason.)

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:27.475
Let's go!

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:28.705
(Let's go!)

00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:30.445
Aquaman!

00:02:30.915 --> 00:02:31.975
(Aquaman!)

00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:36.045
(They continue to submerge themselves.)

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:38.715
That was so unpleasant.

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:40.614
- That was so... - Right.

00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:41.984
- Did we do that right? - That was too strong.

00:02:41.985 --> 00:02:43.725
- That was so unpleasant. - I mean...

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:46.495
(Pressing down)

00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:53.235
(Uie got stepped on and dragged in the water.)

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:59.975
(These are the model examples of what they attempted.)

00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:02.705
- The next Aquaman is... - Yes.

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:05.474
- Here. - I feel bad about grabbing...

00:03:05.475 --> 00:03:07.245
- your hair. - It's okay. That's how it's done.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:08.545
- That's how it's done. - Really?

00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:09.815
Shall we go?

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:12.554
(She grabs In Ah's hair and sets off.)

00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:15.485
(Heave-ho)

00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:18.895
(Let's go.)

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:22.195
(I'm Aquaman.)

00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:26.534
- Did it work? - I think so.

00:03:26.535 --> 00:03:27.965
I did it, right?

00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:29.365
I stood up, right?

00:03:29.535 --> 00:03:31.035
I want to do it again.

00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:33.975
Ma'am, you need to pay the entrance fee.

00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:35.905
You need to pay to grab the hair.

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:37.744
- It's five dollars. - My hair is a great handle, right?

00:03:37.745 --> 00:03:39.774
- Yes. Let's go. - Let's begin.

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:41.414
- How do we do it? - Uie, just...

00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:43.415
(Let's go.)

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.155
(Dodging)

00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:46.285
(Sharp)

00:03:46.785 --> 00:03:48.525
(Solemn)

00:03:48.855 --> 00:03:50.785
(I'm Aquaman.)

00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:51.995
(Laughing)

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:53.794
Hey, it's no joke under the water.

00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:55.765
- It's so funny under the water. - Was it okay?

00:03:58.165 --> 00:03:59.635
(Pressing down)

00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:05.935
(Kicking hard)

00:04:06.675 --> 00:04:08.374
Sae Rok is strong.

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:09.875
You should try Muay Thai.

00:04:10.775 --> 00:04:12.274
She has strong kicks.

00:04:12.275 --> 00:04:13.715
- She's good at riding. - Yes.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.315
When she suddenly got up,

00:04:16.545 --> 00:04:17.714
I went like this.

00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:19.415
(Iron Children are having fun.)

00:04:19.615 --> 00:04:23.225
Are you guys going to try swimming?

00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:25.225
This pool...

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.625
- is 15m. - Okay.

00:04:27.695 --> 00:04:29.095
What's the distance if you make ten laps?

00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:31.594
- What are we doing? - Ten laps?

00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:32.665
Aren't you going to stretch your muscles?

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:35.205
I don't want to play with her.

00:04:36.035 --> 00:04:37.875
But we really need to stretch our muscles.

00:04:37.975 --> 00:04:40.034
Since we're used to boxing,

00:04:40.035 --> 00:04:42.045
swimming is a rehabilitation exercise.

00:04:42.075 --> 00:04:44.174
Let's just have six laps.

00:04:44.175 --> 00:04:45.344
- Let's go. Okay. - Let's go.

00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:47.075
- Let's go. - Get ready.

00:04:48.645 --> 00:04:50.085
Set, go.

00:04:55.725 --> 00:04:58.595
(Ju Hyun, Sae Rok)

00:04:59.795 --> 00:05:01.194
- She's good. - She's good.

00:05:01.195 --> 00:05:02.224
(Sae Rok has impressive swimming skills.)

00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:04.065
- What? - They look pretty.

00:05:06.295 --> 00:05:07.335
They're really good.

00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:15.845
(Having done a triathlon, Ju Hyun can swim easily.)

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:23.985
(The ace member, Uie sets off.)

00:05:27.085 --> 00:05:28.554
She's so fast.

00:05:28.555 --> 00:05:29.655
(She reaches the halfway point in no time.)

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:32.425
You're cool. Gosh, she's so fast.

00:05:33.155 --> 00:05:35.425
(In Ah sets off.)

00:05:40.395 --> 00:05:44.165
(Mermaid Seol is back.)

00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:49.375
(Swimming Queen, Uie)

00:05:55.345 --> 00:05:56.614
They're really good.

00:05:56.615 --> 00:05:58.415
(They are both so good.)

00:05:59.015 --> 00:06:02.725
(Iron Girls don't forget to train even during playtime.)

00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:06.055
(They finish warming up during playtime.)

00:06:06.355 --> 00:06:07.594
I did my best.

00:06:07.595 --> 00:06:08.925
How do you breathe?

00:06:09.865 --> 00:06:11.264
- Now, - Yes?

00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:12.794
let's wash up and get ready.

00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:13.935
- Okay. - Okay.

00:06:14.565 --> 00:06:17.104
You guys always use my shampoo,

00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:18.434
so I brought it from home.

00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:19.474
Yes!

00:06:19.475 --> 00:06:21.604
When I shampoo my hair abroad,

00:06:21.605 --> 00:06:22.904
it becomes very frizzy...

00:06:22.905 --> 00:06:24.544
- and brittle. - That's right.

00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:25.574
- Thank you. - Yes.

00:06:25.575 --> 00:06:27.214
But this shampoo is different.

00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:28.585
- Really? - Let me use it.

00:06:28.785 --> 00:06:30.184
- You'll take a shower first, right? - Yes.

00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:31.955
- Shall we go inside? - Yes.

00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:35.084
(They take time to get ready for a refreshing day.)

00:06:35.085 --> 00:06:36.254
It's really nice.

00:06:36.255 --> 00:06:37.555
It even smells nice.

00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:40.424
I just shampooed my hair, but it turned very soft.

00:06:40.425 --> 00:06:41.994
Right? It's like using a treatment,

00:06:41.995 --> 00:06:43.224
- right? - Yes.

00:06:43.225 --> 00:06:45.294
My hair becomes damaged in an instant...

00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:47.065
if the water isn't right abroad.

00:06:47.295 --> 00:06:49.534
And since my hair is short,

00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:51.135
it needs volume.

00:06:51.235 --> 00:06:52.935
When I use this product, it becomes voluminous.

00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:54.334
Dry your hair.

00:06:54.335 --> 00:06:59.314
(Dry your hair well.)

00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:00.345
It's nice.

00:07:01.345 --> 00:07:04.115
- My hair became voluminous. - Yes.

00:07:04.285 --> 00:07:06.454
There's more volume,

00:07:06.455 --> 00:07:08.155
- right? - Seriously.

00:07:08.755 --> 00:07:10.184
Let's go and train.

00:07:10.185 --> 00:07:12.095
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:14.895
- Hello, Captain. - Hey.

00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:18.135
What will happen in the afternoon?

00:07:18.295 --> 00:07:19.994
There are boxing gyms here and there.

00:07:19.995 --> 00:07:21.204
There are boxing gyms everywhere.

00:07:21.205 --> 00:07:23.735
- "Muay Thai." - "Boxing."

00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:26.034
People love Muay Thai here.

00:07:26.035 --> 00:07:27.334
A Korean equivalent...

00:07:27.335 --> 00:07:29.645
- would be a taekwondo village. - Seriously.

00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:31.414
(Which training will Iron Girls do?)

00:07:31.415 --> 00:07:33.245
- It's Muay Thai! - All right.

00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:34.584
When you think of Thailand,

00:07:34.585 --> 00:07:35.684
- Muay Thai comes to mind. - Yes.

00:07:35.685 --> 00:07:36.814
Let me tell you about this place.

00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:38.214
In Phuket,

00:07:38.215 --> 00:07:39.954
it's the biggest Muay Thai gym.

00:07:39.955 --> 00:07:41.685
(The biggest Muay Thai gym in Phuket)

00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:44.424
(It's the most popular gym in Phuket.)

00:07:44.425 --> 00:07:47.294
Muay Thai and boxing have many things in common.

00:07:47.295 --> 00:07:48.494
They influence each other a lot.

00:07:48.495 --> 00:07:52.064
Thus, this gym has a lot to do with boxing as well.

00:07:52.065 --> 00:07:54.395
- Also, a special coach... - Okay.

00:07:54.705 --> 00:07:56.605
is waiting in the ring inside.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:58.574
Is this person a local?

00:07:58.575 --> 00:08:00.034
Yes, this person is a foreigner.

00:08:00.035 --> 00:08:01.644
- I won't tell you more. - Sure.

00:08:01.645 --> 00:08:03.475
I think this coach will be a woman.

00:08:03.745 --> 00:08:04.814
Let's go and meet the coach.

00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:06.445
- Okay. - Let's go.

00:08:06.515 --> 00:08:07.985
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:08:08.815 --> 00:08:10.914
I feel like I'm entering an amusement park.

00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:12.715
You'll be shocked if you check out the back.

00:08:16.355 --> 00:08:18.355
- No way! This is so fascinating. - It's the coolest.

00:08:19.995 --> 00:08:21.725
(When you walk inside the gym)

00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:26.235
I feel like I've entered a strange world.

00:08:26.635 --> 00:08:27.935
If you walk to the back,

00:08:28.205 --> 00:08:29.234
you'll keep seeing more booths.

00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:31.164
(Countless exercise booths appear.)

00:08:31.165 --> 00:08:32.375
What's this?

00:08:32.535 --> 00:08:35.404
I think we've traveled through time and space.

00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:38.145
(There's no end in sight. It's a huge gym.)

00:08:39.075 --> 00:08:41.045
(This place is like a paradise to athletes.)

00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:43.844
(It's full of fighters...)

00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:46.085
(from around the world.)

00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:47.985
There's a baby, too.

00:08:48.085 --> 00:08:51.755
(They also offer a variety of fitness classes.)

00:08:52.055 --> 00:08:54.055
(It's a haven for athletes.)

00:08:54.395 --> 00:08:55.594
It must be a famous place.

00:08:55.595 --> 00:08:56.925
They sell souvenirs.

00:08:57.795 --> 00:08:59.865
I want to buy their boxing shorts.

00:09:00.095 --> 00:09:01.565
There are so many items.

00:09:02.205 --> 00:09:03.465
I think the gloves are pretty.

00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:05.274
(There's even a restaurant...)

00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:06.905
(where you can get protein after exercising.)

00:09:06.935 --> 00:09:09.144
This place is a different world.

00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:10.275
(The location of today's training is like a martial arts theme park.)

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:13.275
I didn't know that such a place existed.

00:09:13.545 --> 00:09:15.044
They're doing knee kicks.

00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:16.945
(Everywhere they look, people are doing martial arts.)

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.414
This place is no joke.

00:09:18.415 --> 00:09:19.854
It's seriously cool.

00:09:19.855 --> 00:09:22.525
This place is like a new world.

00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:26.025
Hey!

00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:27.695
- What? - I think it's her!

00:09:28.495 --> 00:09:31.695
(Is there someone in the ring?)

00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:33.064
- What? - I think it's her!

00:09:33.065 --> 00:09:34.234
She's so cool. What's going on?

00:09:34.235 --> 00:09:35.764
- What? - There she is.

00:09:35.765 --> 00:09:37.105
- What? - Let's go.

00:09:43.105 --> 00:09:46.175
(Her fierce movements are unrivaled.)

00:09:48.345 --> 00:09:52.215
(Who is this extraordinary boxer?)

00:09:53.015 --> 00:09:54.114
(Shouting)

00:09:54.115 --> 00:09:55.355
She's good.

00:09:56.825 --> 00:09:58.894
(Their jaws drop.)

00:09:58.895 --> 00:10:00.055
She's strong.

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:08.405
(They approach cautiously.)

00:10:09.065 --> 00:10:11.634
(Is she the special coach?)

00:10:11.635 --> 00:10:13.205
I'll call the coach.

00:10:13.775 --> 00:10:15.375
- Coach. - Hi.

00:10:16.505 --> 00:10:17.544
- Hi. - Hi.

00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:19.074
Nice to meet you.

00:10:19.075 --> 00:10:21.045
- Are you finished? - I'm finished. I'm done.

00:10:21.615 --> 00:10:23.615
(Iron Girls can't take their eyes off of her.)

00:10:23.745 --> 00:10:25.755
She's our special coach.

00:10:25.815 --> 00:10:27.685
She's the world champion in boxing.

00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:32.225
How are we meeting the world champion?

00:10:32.525 --> 00:10:34.425
(Number 1 in the world?)

00:10:34.525 --> 00:10:36.324
She's Coach Shannon Courtenay.

00:10:36.325 --> 00:10:38.335
(Shannon Courtenay)

00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:41.234
(World-class boxer)

00:10:41.235 --> 00:10:44.105
(WBA champion)

00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:46.975
(She's a professional boxer from the UK.)

00:10:47.305 --> 00:10:50.005
(She began boxing in 2015.)

00:10:50.745 --> 00:10:53.545
(In 4 years, she became a professional boxer.)

00:10:54.915 --> 00:10:56.515
(In just 2 years after becoming a professional,)

00:10:57.045 --> 00:11:00.555
(she held the WBA bantamweight title.)

00:11:01.525 --> 00:11:03.655
(Boxing world champion, Shannon Courtenay)

00:11:03.985 --> 00:11:05.995
(She's a world champion.)

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:07.894
- She's cool. - Can you introduce yourself?

00:11:07.895 --> 00:11:09.264
Hi, I'm Shannon Courtenay...

00:11:09.265 --> 00:11:11.795
and I'm the WBA bantamweight world champion.

00:11:12.035 --> 00:11:13.935
Okay. Gosh.

00:11:14.195 --> 00:11:15.305
Seriously.

00:11:15.905 --> 00:11:17.265
- She's cool. - Right.

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:19.934
She's very hard to meet.

00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:22.944
She's at the top of the world in this field.

00:11:22.945 --> 00:11:25.375
I knew something about her she was different.

00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:26.845
How old are you?

00:11:26.975 --> 00:11:28.145
I'm 31.

00:11:28.285 --> 00:11:29.645
- Thirty-one? - Thirty-one?

00:11:29.685 --> 00:11:31.485
- She looks very young. - I know.

00:11:31.555 --> 00:11:33.355
You've got a baby face.

00:11:33.815 --> 00:11:35.484
That's my name. Baby Face.

00:11:35.485 --> 00:11:36.854
Your name?

00:11:36.855 --> 00:11:38.895
- Really? - Really?

00:11:38.925 --> 00:11:40.394
- Nickname? - Is her nickname Baby Face?

00:11:40.395 --> 00:11:42.724
My boxing name is Baby Face Assassin.

00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:43.894
(Shannon's boxing name, Baby Face Assassin)

00:11:43.895 --> 00:11:45.234
Baby Face.

00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:46.235
I knew it.

00:11:46.236 --> 00:11:47.635
Baby Face Assassin.

00:11:47.695 --> 00:11:49.105
- Baby Face Assassin. - How cute.

00:11:49.505 --> 00:11:51.635
- That's scary. - Baby Face Assassin.

00:11:51.835 --> 00:11:53.004
That's scary.

00:11:53.005 --> 00:11:54.534
(Innocent face and not-so-innocent name)

00:11:54.535 --> 00:11:56.144
Since she's on another level,

00:11:56.145 --> 00:11:57.344
- I don't know where to begin... - Same here.

00:11:57.345 --> 00:11:59.014
or what to ask.

00:11:59.015 --> 00:12:01.814
When did you begin boxing?

00:12:01.815 --> 00:12:02.944
How old were you?

00:12:02.945 --> 00:12:04.015
Ten years.

00:12:04.215 --> 00:12:05.485
- Really? - Ten years.

00:12:05.685 --> 00:12:08.355
I won my world title in my seventh fight.

00:12:08.785 --> 00:12:11.525
(The unbelievable record makes their jaws drop.)

00:12:11.925 --> 00:12:13.354
(Shannon points to something.)

00:12:13.355 --> 00:12:14.625
It's here.

00:12:15.325 --> 00:12:16.625
- Can I... - Yes!

00:12:17.095 --> 00:12:18.195
What's that?

00:12:18.365 --> 00:12:20.695
(It shines in its glory.)

00:12:22.035 --> 00:12:24.605
(WBA Champion Belt)

00:12:25.275 --> 00:12:26.874
It's my first time seeing it.

00:12:26.875 --> 00:12:28.745
- Isn't it a decoration? - I want it.

00:12:28.805 --> 00:12:29.944
Everyone.

00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:30.974
Isn't it a decoration?

00:12:30.975 --> 00:12:32.274
World Boxing Association.

00:12:32.275 --> 00:12:33.614
(World Boxing Association)

00:12:33.615 --> 00:12:35.445
- I want to touch it. - Touch it.

00:12:35.615 --> 00:12:37.545
- It's so cool. - I want to touch it.

00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:38.915
Can I...

00:12:40.185 --> 00:12:41.925
- Can I try it on? - Yes. Of course, you can.

00:12:42.725 --> 00:12:44.855
- How is it? Does it suit me? - Leave it on.

00:12:45.325 --> 00:12:46.525
It doesn't suit you.

00:12:46.625 --> 00:12:47.855
It doesn't suit you.

00:12:47.955 --> 00:12:49.365
- Doesn't it suit me? - Do this.

00:12:51.535 --> 00:12:53.994
- It's so heavy. - Seriously, it's heavy.

00:12:53.995 --> 00:12:55.035
(Heavy)

00:12:55.565 --> 00:12:58.574
Gosh, my baby.

00:12:58.575 --> 00:13:00.305
(She's cute.)

00:13:00.505 --> 00:13:02.544
- This is incredible. - This is...

00:13:02.545 --> 00:13:03.745
The weight...

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.644
I'll put it here.

00:13:05.645 --> 00:13:07.574
(Shannon's champion belt is very fascinating.)

00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:09.484
Does a professional boxer...

00:13:09.485 --> 00:13:12.155
get stressed out about losing weight?

00:13:12.355 --> 00:13:14.655
The competition is next week, but these two...

00:13:14.815 --> 00:13:17.854
are stressed out because they can't lose 2kg.

00:13:17.855 --> 00:13:19.194
- Did you say 2kg? - Yes.

00:13:19.195 --> 00:13:21.055
I could do that in one hour.

00:13:21.425 --> 00:13:22.464
(1 hour?)

00:13:22.465 --> 00:13:24.124
- Just wear a sweat suit... - Oh, my gosh.

00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:25.694
and skip, and it'll come off.

00:13:25.695 --> 00:13:27.795
Okay. Let's stop being weak.

00:13:28.365 --> 00:13:30.704
- I was very fat. - Yes?

00:13:30.705 --> 00:13:32.604
I smoked. I drank.

00:13:32.605 --> 00:13:34.944
And I wanted to get fit.

00:13:34.945 --> 00:13:36.575
And I loved boxing.

00:13:36.905 --> 00:13:38.144
And I stuck to it.

00:13:38.145 --> 00:13:39.774
And I got fit. I lost weight.

00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:41.015
And I've become the world champion.

00:13:41.645 --> 00:13:44.345
- So, this was me before boxing. - Okay.

00:13:46.615 --> 00:13:47.615
Really?

00:13:48.555 --> 00:13:49.854
- You're a liar. - It's me.

00:13:49.855 --> 00:13:51.555
- No. No way. - It's me.

00:13:51.855 --> 00:13:52.855
When?

00:13:52.856 --> 00:13:54.694
(Shannon before taking up boxing 10 years ago)

00:13:54.695 --> 00:13:56.364
I lost 30kg.

00:13:56.365 --> 00:13:58.095
(After losing 30kg)

00:13:58.565 --> 00:14:00.135
(Impressive)

00:14:00.235 --> 00:14:01.365
30kg.

00:14:01.835 --> 00:14:06.674
Let's begin the one-point lesson from the boxing champion.

00:14:06.675 --> 00:14:08.474
- We're in your care. - Thank you.

00:14:08.475 --> 00:14:11.304
Today, which training will come first?

00:14:11.305 --> 00:14:12.915
We're going to do skipping.

00:14:12.945 --> 00:14:14.174
We're going to do the ladder,

00:14:14.175 --> 00:14:15.344
padwork...

00:14:15.345 --> 00:14:17.084
And then we're going to do technical sparring.

00:14:17.085 --> 00:14:18.485
I'll spar you,

00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:20.714
but technically.

00:14:20.715 --> 00:14:22.224
- Okay. - Not too heavy.

00:14:22.225 --> 00:14:23.285
Okay.

00:14:23.455 --> 00:14:24.554
I can't believe it!

00:14:24.555 --> 00:14:25.895
Will I be in the ring with her?

00:14:25.955 --> 00:14:27.154
Can I really do that?

00:14:27.155 --> 00:14:28.195
(I can't believe I'll spar with the world's number 1!)

00:14:28.265 --> 00:14:31.194
It's a precious lesson that can't be bought with money.

00:14:31.195 --> 00:14:32.495
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:14:32.535 --> 00:14:33.535
You know,

00:14:33.536 --> 00:14:35.964
since she currently works as a professional boxer,

00:14:35.965 --> 00:14:38.304
she doesn't teach lessons.

00:14:38.305 --> 00:14:39.734
No, you're my first.

00:14:39.735 --> 00:14:40.804
The first.

00:14:40.805 --> 00:14:42.904
(We're the first students.)

00:14:42.905 --> 00:14:44.345
- I'm the first too. - Oh, my gosh.

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:46.445
- Can I change into my boxing shoes? - Yes.

00:14:46.515 --> 00:14:47.575
I'm going to do my best.

00:14:48.045 --> 00:14:50.315
- I want to put on my boxing shoes. - Okay.

00:14:50.615 --> 00:14:53.115
Let's begin the first lesson.

00:14:54.515 --> 00:14:55.655
Jump ropes?

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:58.894
Coach will watch you first...

00:14:58.895 --> 00:15:01.695
and decide what to teach you.

00:15:01.825 --> 00:15:02.924
Jump rope for a minute.

00:15:02.925 --> 00:15:04.725
It's time to show what you can do.

00:15:05.495 --> 00:15:07.134
- Okay. - Okay. Get ready.

00:15:07.135 --> 00:15:08.164
Set, go.

00:15:08.165 --> 00:15:12.605
(They begin to jump rope for 1 minute.)

00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:16.645
(In Ah warms up with rhythmic jump roping.)

00:15:17.405 --> 00:15:21.275
(She can do high knees with ease now.)

00:15:21.985 --> 00:15:26.285
(Ju Hyun does energetic high knees like a boxer.)

00:15:26.685 --> 00:15:28.755
(Watching carefully)

00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:32.395
(How is Sae Rok doing?)

00:15:33.055 --> 00:15:36.625
(She started out as a beginner at jump roping.)

00:15:37.595 --> 00:15:41.295
(And through intense practice, she improved a lot.)

00:15:41.665 --> 00:15:44.505
(But high knees were still too challenging for her.)

00:15:45.505 --> 00:15:47.305
(How is she doing now, two months later?)

00:15:49.545 --> 00:15:51.205
You practiced jump roping hard.

00:15:51.775 --> 00:15:53.245
You're handling it so smoothly, without any tangles.

00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:58.855
(Sae Rok has mastered even high knees.)

00:15:59.085 --> 00:16:00.215
The last ten seconds.

00:16:00.455 --> 00:16:01.885
High knees for ten seconds.

00:16:02.785 --> 00:16:05.495
Five, four, three,

00:16:05.995 --> 00:16:08.794
two, one. Time's up.

00:16:08.795 --> 00:16:09.865
(What does the world champion think?)

00:16:10.465 --> 00:16:12.594
You're very stiff. You need to relax.

00:16:12.595 --> 00:16:15.135
And make it really easy.

00:16:15.505 --> 00:16:18.165
When you try too much, you're out of breath.

00:16:18.205 --> 00:16:20.975
She says you need to relax and make it light.

00:16:21.005 --> 00:16:22.005
What do we do now?

00:16:22.006 --> 00:16:23.804
- Can we get a glimpse... - Show me.

00:16:23.805 --> 00:16:25.344
of a world champion's jump roping?

00:16:25.345 --> 00:16:26.445
I'm so curious.

00:16:27.245 --> 00:16:29.345
- Show them? - Watching it is part of training.

00:16:31.955 --> 00:16:35.625
(With incredible speed)

00:16:36.385 --> 00:16:37.684
(Gently)

00:16:37.685 --> 00:16:40.225
- Her jump roping... - Nice and easy.

00:16:40.295 --> 00:16:41.965
- Loose and then... - Easy. Relax.

00:16:47.065 --> 00:16:48.634
How does she do that?

00:16:48.635 --> 00:16:49.764
Even after doing all that,

00:16:49.765 --> 00:16:50.864
- she's not out of breath. - Look.

00:16:50.865 --> 00:16:52.635
My arms are really loose.

00:16:52.835 --> 00:16:55.375
- So I'm not out of breath. Easy. - How does she do that?

00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:57.905
Yes?

00:16:58.005 --> 00:17:01.475
Will we be able to jump rope so cool like that?

00:17:01.885 --> 00:17:03.785
Slow. Go on. Ready.

00:17:04.215 --> 00:17:06.284
This one is called a side swing.

00:17:06.285 --> 00:17:08.555
You swing it from side to side. Okay?

00:17:08.725 --> 00:17:10.424
- Swing. - Swing.

00:17:10.425 --> 00:17:12.094
- Go around. - Around.

00:17:12.095 --> 00:17:13.955
(Step 1: Swinging from side to side)

00:17:14.055 --> 00:17:15.595
- Okay. - And then you go...

00:17:15.895 --> 00:17:19.135
(Step 2: Swinging from side to side and single unders)

00:17:20.265 --> 00:17:22.435
(Now, they each practice the side swing.)

00:17:23.365 --> 00:17:25.274
That's it. Uie is doing it.

00:17:25.275 --> 00:17:26.405
- Gosh. - Hang on.

00:17:26.575 --> 00:17:28.335
- And then you go... - Jumping.

00:17:29.075 --> 00:17:30.305
- How do I do that? - Jumping.

00:17:30.775 --> 00:17:32.644
(It's not easy even for In Ah, the Sports Genius.)

00:17:32.645 --> 00:17:34.175
When should I jump?

00:17:35.415 --> 00:17:38.654
- Swing twice and jump. - Yes.

00:17:38.655 --> 00:17:40.415
- Yes. - Swing and...

00:17:40.815 --> 00:17:42.684
- She's got it. - Swing twice and jump.

00:17:42.685 --> 00:17:44.154
(She quickly got the hang of it after a few tries.)

00:17:44.155 --> 00:17:45.555
- Gosh. - How do you do that?

00:17:45.655 --> 00:17:46.994
(Jumping lightly)

00:17:46.995 --> 00:17:48.094
- Yes. - How is she so good at it?

00:17:48.095 --> 00:17:49.694
Wait. What do you do after this?

00:17:49.695 --> 00:17:51.125
You're so good.

00:17:51.565 --> 00:17:54.235
If you jump rope like that, you look like you're good at it.

00:17:54.895 --> 00:17:56.904
(The second move)

00:17:56.905 --> 00:17:59.205
(Double unders)

00:17:59.475 --> 00:18:00.674
- Right? - Double unders.

00:18:00.675 --> 00:18:03.175
- Double unders. - On a jump, twice. Twice around.

00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:05.875
I really want to do this.

00:18:06.145 --> 00:18:07.445
Ju Hyun, show us.

00:18:07.975 --> 00:18:12.214
(Ju Hyun's double unders)

00:18:12.215 --> 00:18:14.385
(She performed 7 double unders.)

00:18:14.615 --> 00:18:16.685
We should enter Ju Hyun in a jump rope competition.

00:18:17.285 --> 00:18:20.124
(In Ah's double unders)

00:18:20.125 --> 00:18:21.455
In Ah is good.

00:18:21.755 --> 00:18:23.065
In Ah is doing well.

00:18:23.865 --> 00:18:24.894
Gosh.

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:26.464
- How many times did you do that? - Yes.

00:18:26.465 --> 00:18:28.165
(She's good.)

00:18:28.365 --> 00:18:29.805
In Ah is good.

00:18:30.535 --> 00:18:34.535
Okay. Now, with all the skills I taught you,

00:18:34.735 --> 00:18:37.645
you will jump rope for nine minutes. Okay?

00:18:37.805 --> 00:18:39.175
- Nine minutes? - Nine minutes?

00:18:39.675 --> 00:18:42.415
I've never done it for nine minutes without a break.

00:18:42.445 --> 00:18:44.044
- Are you ready? - Yes.

00:18:44.045 --> 00:18:45.814
- It's not easy. - One, two, three.

00:18:45.815 --> 00:18:46.985
- Go. - Go.

00:18:47.355 --> 00:18:48.455
For nine minutes, without stopping.

00:18:49.025 --> 00:18:51.284
- Just be simple. Basic. - Jump.

00:18:51.285 --> 00:18:53.125
- Easy. - Easy.

00:18:53.325 --> 00:18:55.055
- Easy. - Easy.

00:18:55.525 --> 00:18:56.565
Easy.

00:18:57.165 --> 00:18:58.195
Easy.

00:18:58.865 --> 00:19:01.364
I like this one the most.

00:19:01.365 --> 00:19:04.864
(They relax their body and try the skills they learned 1 by 1.)

00:19:04.865 --> 00:19:05.935
Next leg.

00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:07.935
Next leg.

00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:11.545
(Their side swings look smoother than before.)

00:19:12.345 --> 00:19:15.245
(Trying hard)

00:19:15.585 --> 00:19:16.745
Three minutes.

00:19:17.485 --> 00:19:19.855
- I can't believe this. - Keep going.

00:19:19.985 --> 00:19:22.284
Just be simple. Basic.

00:19:22.285 --> 00:19:23.354
(For a long 9 minutes,)

00:19:23.355 --> 00:19:25.425
(Iron Girls keep jumping without stopping.)

00:19:25.895 --> 00:19:27.124
(Last 10 seconds)

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.064
- Ten seconds. - Ten seconds.

00:19:29.065 --> 00:19:31.665
(Burning with a final spurt)

00:19:31.765 --> 00:19:33.634
- Booster. Jump. - Keep going.

00:19:33.635 --> 00:19:36.505
(The members jump until the end.)

00:19:37.005 --> 00:19:38.834
(The 9-minute jump roping is over.)

00:19:38.835 --> 00:19:39.975
Well done.

00:19:40.175 --> 00:19:41.375
I feel like throwing up.

00:19:43.175 --> 00:19:44.945
(Worn out)

00:19:45.205 --> 00:19:46.215
Gosh, this is...

00:19:46.475 --> 00:19:48.745
- Drink lots of water. - Okay.

00:19:48.845 --> 00:19:50.945
- Coach, what's the next training? - Next.

00:19:51.285 --> 00:19:53.885
The next is footwork drills using the ladder.

00:19:53.955 --> 00:19:55.215
I just can't do this.

00:19:55.625 --> 00:19:58.825
We do have good footwork.

00:19:59.125 --> 00:20:00.895
We've practiced it a lot.

00:20:01.155 --> 00:20:03.265
(During their individual training,)

00:20:04.065 --> 00:20:07.035
(they've been training footwork using the ladder.)

00:20:07.365 --> 00:20:09.164
Since you've practiced hard,

00:20:09.165 --> 00:20:11.635
I want you to show her how good you are at this.

00:20:11.835 --> 00:20:13.934
Please show us one of your best moves.

00:20:13.935 --> 00:20:15.575
Then we will try the same.

00:20:15.805 --> 00:20:16.945
The fastest?

00:20:17.845 --> 00:20:19.045
(If it's something fast...)

00:20:21.675 --> 00:20:22.685
That's In Ah's thing.

00:20:22.715 --> 00:20:24.545
- That's In Ah's thing. - In Ah is good at this.

00:20:24.815 --> 00:20:26.755
- This is In Ah's specialty. - In Ah is good at this.

00:20:27.385 --> 00:20:29.225
(This footwork drill is...)

00:20:30.285 --> 00:20:34.595
(In the previous season, it surprised everyone.)

00:20:35.995 --> 00:20:36.995
Hang on.

00:20:37.925 --> 00:20:41.595
(In Ah's first moment as the Sports Genius)

00:20:41.735 --> 00:20:42.765
Hang on.

00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:44.505
- Is that it? - She did it.

00:20:45.575 --> 00:20:48.605
(This is the side three-step)

00:20:48.805 --> 00:20:51.505
Actually, I was hoping she would do this.

00:20:51.605 --> 00:20:53.515
- I wanted her to show this. - Show us, In Ah.

00:20:53.915 --> 00:20:56.415
Then, I'll time this.

00:20:56.585 --> 00:20:59.184
When you reach the end, finish it like this.

00:20:59.185 --> 00:21:00.415
- Okay. - Okay.

00:21:00.655 --> 00:21:02.024
(Shannon goes first.)

00:21:02.025 --> 00:21:03.025
Ready.

00:21:03.385 --> 00:21:05.324
(What is the speed of the world champion like?)

00:21:05.325 --> 00:21:06.355
Go.

00:21:07.155 --> 00:21:08.195
Go.

00:21:10.725 --> 00:21:12.735
(Their jaws drop open at the incredible speed.)

00:21:13.065 --> 00:21:14.635
Ready, go.

00:21:20.275 --> 00:21:23.145
All right. It's 4.97 seconds.

00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:25.275
- Did you say 4 seconds? - It's 4.97 seconds.

00:21:25.375 --> 00:21:26.815
- My gosh. - It's 4.97 seconds.

00:21:27.115 --> 00:21:28.885
(Uie is the second.)

00:21:29.345 --> 00:21:30.385
Ready.

00:21:31.745 --> 00:21:33.185
Start.

00:21:35.825 --> 00:21:36.925
She's fast.

00:21:37.085 --> 00:21:38.824
- Yes. - Uie.

00:21:38.825 --> 00:21:39.895
Okay.

00:21:40.525 --> 00:21:41.595
It's 6.10 seconds.

00:21:42.225 --> 00:21:44.425
- What's with you, Uie? Yes! - I've improved a lot, right?

00:21:45.165 --> 00:21:47.065
I just want to beat Park Ju Hyun.

00:21:47.435 --> 00:21:48.464
(It won't be easy.)

00:21:48.465 --> 00:21:50.265
- I just want to beat Park Ju Hyun. - Ready.

00:21:50.805 --> 00:21:52.005
Start.

00:21:53.875 --> 00:21:55.134
Good.

00:21:55.135 --> 00:21:56.344
- Your footstep looks light. - Don't trip.

00:21:56.345 --> 00:21:57.375
Focus.

00:21:58.345 --> 00:21:59.345
Okay.

00:21:59.845 --> 00:22:01.244
(Shannon: 4.97 seconds, Uie: 6.10 seconds,)

00:22:01.245 --> 00:22:02.285
(Ju Hyun: 6.54 seconds)

00:22:02.715 --> 00:22:04.285
Ready. Start.

00:22:05.345 --> 00:22:06.554
Good.

00:22:06.555 --> 00:22:08.414
- Focus. - Don't trip.

00:22:08.415 --> 00:22:09.825
She's about to trip.

00:22:09.985 --> 00:22:10.985
Okay.

00:22:11.655 --> 00:22:14.254
It's 6.10 seconds. It's a tie.

00:22:14.255 --> 00:22:15.465
- With whom? - Me.

00:22:16.295 --> 00:22:17.564
Is that because she is light-footed?

00:22:17.565 --> 00:22:19.764
- Yes. - Now we have our Simba Seol.

00:22:19.765 --> 00:22:22.035
Seol In Ah is up next.

00:22:22.205 --> 00:22:24.134
- She's the best. - Best?

00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:25.675
- Okay. - Ready.

00:22:26.405 --> 00:22:28.205
(She has everyone's expectations on her shoulders.)

00:22:28.705 --> 00:22:30.304
(Will she be able to beat the champion?)

00:22:30.305 --> 00:22:32.445
Start.

00:22:34.315 --> 00:22:37.145
(Her expression changes as soon as she starts.)

00:22:39.715 --> 00:22:42.055
(As expected, her speed is overwhelming.)

00:22:43.085 --> 00:22:44.085
(What?)

00:22:44.086 --> 00:22:46.825
Go. Keep going.

00:22:47.625 --> 00:22:48.764
- My gosh. - Okay.

00:22:48.765 --> 00:22:50.795
Go. Keep going.

00:22:50.925 --> 00:22:52.365
Okay. What?

00:22:54.295 --> 00:22:56.365
(What is In Ah's record?)

00:22:58.165 --> 00:22:59.375
It's 4.86 seconds.

00:22:59.935 --> 00:23:01.934
My gosh. It's 4.86 seconds.

00:23:01.935 --> 00:23:04.574
Faster than me? My goodness.

00:23:04.575 --> 00:23:05.644
(Truly surprised)

00:23:05.645 --> 00:23:06.715
Look.

00:23:07.245 --> 00:23:08.315
Start.

00:23:10.615 --> 00:23:12.684
Go. Keep going.

00:23:12.685 --> 00:23:14.255
Okay. What?

00:23:14.585 --> 00:23:16.324
She was 0.11 seconds faster.

00:23:16.325 --> 00:23:18.025
- My gosh. - You're amazing.

00:23:18.485 --> 00:23:21.955
(Simba Seol beat the champion with her footwork.)

00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:23.495
She's really impressive.

00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:26.165
(Thumbs-up)

00:23:26.565 --> 00:23:28.395
She's really fast. How can she do that?

00:23:28.535 --> 00:23:30.065
In Ah, you did it.

00:23:30.505 --> 00:23:33.374
You've trained your footwork a lot.

00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:34.504
Right.

00:23:34.505 --> 00:23:36.375
You managed to show that to the coach.

00:23:36.505 --> 00:23:37.675
- What's next? - Next.

00:23:37.905 --> 00:23:39.374
- Okay. Come this way. - Okay.

00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:40.674
- Okay. - Okay.

00:23:40.675 --> 00:23:41.775
The first one.

00:23:42.785 --> 00:23:49.155
(Standing side by side with Shannon,)

00:23:50.085 --> 00:23:54.224
(they learn various steps.)

00:23:54.225 --> 00:23:56.465
- The first. - I'm honored.

00:23:56.965 --> 00:23:58.065
I'm doing this with her.

00:23:59.165 --> 00:24:02.335
(Learning the steps for a while)

00:24:02.905 --> 00:24:04.435
I think I've improved a little.

00:24:05.135 --> 00:24:07.404
Do this every session until your fight.

00:24:07.405 --> 00:24:10.205
Keep your feet fast and get ready for your fight.

00:24:10.445 --> 00:24:11.575
- Okay. - Yes.

00:24:12.345 --> 00:24:14.115
What's next?

00:24:14.245 --> 00:24:17.245
I'm going to take all of you on the pads. One round each.

00:24:17.415 --> 00:24:18.715
(Will she be wearing the mitts?)

00:24:18.915 --> 00:24:21.785
I wonder if the coach has ever taken anyone on the pads before.

00:24:21.985 --> 00:24:23.025
No.

00:24:24.025 --> 00:24:25.085
- First time? - Yes.

00:24:25.555 --> 00:24:27.095
- First time ever? - Yes.

00:24:27.955 --> 00:24:29.465
This is really...

00:24:29.995 --> 00:24:32.564
She's doing this for the first time in her life.

00:24:32.565 --> 00:24:33.965
What do I do? I'm nervous.

00:24:34.795 --> 00:24:36.165
I really want to do well.

00:24:36.405 --> 00:24:40.075
How are you going to do the mitt work?

00:24:40.305 --> 00:24:42.274
Each girl is going to get two minutes.

00:24:42.275 --> 00:24:44.545
- Two minutes. - For two minutes.

00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:45.844
Okay.

00:24:45.845 --> 00:24:47.444
What do I do? I'm nervous.

00:24:47.445 --> 00:24:48.574
(Uie goes first.)

00:24:48.575 --> 00:24:50.145
- Here? Alright. Jab. - Yes.

00:24:50.515 --> 00:24:51.814
(The 2-minute mitt work begins.)

00:24:51.815 --> 00:24:52.855
Jab.

00:24:53.055 --> 00:24:54.985
One, two.

00:24:55.685 --> 00:24:56.685
One, two, hook.

00:24:57.085 --> 00:24:58.955
(Focused)

00:24:59.095 --> 00:25:00.125
Body.

00:25:00.795 --> 00:25:01.795
Body.

00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:03.164
Gosh, the body shot.

00:25:03.165 --> 00:25:04.165
(She missed the body shot.)

00:25:04.425 --> 00:25:07.295
All right. Let's get this. You only need to go down.

00:25:07.495 --> 00:25:09.735
(She should lean forward and shift weight onto the front foot.)

00:25:09.805 --> 00:25:10.934
- Go down? - So...

00:25:10.935 --> 00:25:13.004
- Duck down and up. - I see.

00:25:13.005 --> 00:25:15.335
(Punching as she comes up)

00:25:16.205 --> 00:25:18.775
There you go. Again. One more.

00:25:19.345 --> 00:25:20.345
Body.

00:25:20.346 --> 00:25:22.074
(Before and after)

00:25:22.075 --> 00:25:23.415
You should bend your body completely.

00:25:24.085 --> 00:25:27.155
(She improved her posture by bending her body as she learned.)

00:25:28.215 --> 00:25:29.525
There you go. Again.

00:25:29.855 --> 00:25:30.855
One more.

00:25:30.856 --> 00:25:31.924
(Her body shot has become heavier.)

00:25:31.925 --> 00:25:33.025
There you go. Jab.

00:25:33.695 --> 00:25:35.864
- I see. After shifting her weight. - Good.

00:25:35.865 --> 00:25:36.894
(Studying hard)

00:25:36.895 --> 00:25:39.265
(Like this!)

00:25:39.395 --> 00:25:42.635
(She checks Uie's posture again with an eagle eye.)

00:25:43.065 --> 00:25:44.135
(One, two)

00:25:44.865 --> 00:25:46.104
That's your best punch.

00:25:46.105 --> 00:25:47.175
One, two.

00:25:47.805 --> 00:25:49.575
Now, just a big two.

00:25:49.645 --> 00:25:51.145
- Big two. - It's been a minute.

00:25:51.245 --> 00:25:52.415
Again.

00:25:52.675 --> 00:25:53.745
Again.

00:25:54.675 --> 00:25:56.185
Good shot. One, two.

00:25:57.545 --> 00:25:59.055
(The maximum distance straight punch)

00:25:59.655 --> 00:26:01.415
- Okay. Harder. - Good shot. One, two.

00:26:01.815 --> 00:26:03.984
(Powerful straight)

00:26:03.985 --> 00:26:05.385
- Her one-two is really good. - She's amazing.

00:26:05.795 --> 00:26:07.925
- Her one-two is great. - She's good.

00:26:08.595 --> 00:26:11.324
(Her specialty, the powerful straight punch,)

00:26:11.325 --> 00:26:13.295
(has been upgraded.)

00:26:13.365 --> 00:26:14.395
Jab.

00:26:14.495 --> 00:26:15.535
- Ten seconds. - One, two.

00:26:15.905 --> 00:26:16.935
Two.

00:26:16.965 --> 00:26:18.004
Two.

00:26:18.005 --> 00:26:19.005
Two.

00:26:19.006 --> 00:26:22.745
(The last 10 seconds to burn everything up)

00:26:23.075 --> 00:26:26.444
Two.

00:26:26.445 --> 00:26:29.484
(Uie's mitt work is over.)

00:26:29.485 --> 00:26:30.845
Well done.

00:26:32.315 --> 00:26:33.914
- Thank you. - Well done.

00:26:33.915 --> 00:26:34.984
(Hugging)

00:26:34.985 --> 00:26:36.454
You told me...

00:26:36.455 --> 00:26:38.525
to use a lot of one-twos during the match,

00:26:38.685 --> 00:26:41.525
but I'm still not sure how to adjust the distance.

00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:43.865
- Because you have long arms, - Yes.

00:26:43.895 --> 00:26:45.934
if you blind them with a jab,

00:26:45.935 --> 00:26:47.235
then you go like this.

00:26:48.035 --> 00:26:50.004
So, jab and punch.

00:26:50.005 --> 00:26:51.265
That's your best shot.

00:26:51.665 --> 00:26:52.674
(Jab and punch)

00:26:52.675 --> 00:26:53.934
- There you go. - Thank you.

00:26:53.935 --> 00:26:54.974
You're welcome.

00:26:54.975 --> 00:26:56.504
It's been three months...

00:26:56.505 --> 00:26:57.944
since they started boxing.

00:26:57.945 --> 00:27:00.214
What do you think of her?

00:27:00.215 --> 00:27:02.145
You're ready to fight next week.

00:27:02.945 --> 00:27:04.644
You're ready to fight next week.

00:27:04.645 --> 00:27:07.355
(The champion approves that she's ready to fight.)

00:27:07.685 --> 00:27:10.255
(Jealous)

00:27:10.485 --> 00:27:12.324
I'll show you with my one-twos.

00:27:12.325 --> 00:27:14.324
- Okay. Good. - Thank you.

00:27:14.325 --> 00:27:15.454
Uie. Seriously,

00:27:15.455 --> 00:27:17.924
- your one-twos look so stable. - Really? I'm glad to hear that.

00:27:17.925 --> 00:27:20.035
You're the best. Your twos are so heavy.

00:27:20.065 --> 00:27:21.195
By the way,

00:27:21.535 --> 00:27:23.305
she's a champion indeed.

00:27:23.405 --> 00:27:24.864
She took me on the pads so well.

00:27:24.865 --> 00:27:25.934
(Satisfied)

00:27:25.935 --> 00:27:27.504
Next. Please get ready.

00:27:27.505 --> 00:27:29.504
(Next up is Ju Hyun.)

00:27:29.505 --> 00:27:30.774
- Ready? - Okay.

00:27:30.775 --> 00:27:31.805
Go.

00:27:31.905 --> 00:27:34.845
(The 2-minute mitt work begins.)

00:27:35.015 --> 00:27:38.585
(She checks Ju Hyun's one-two's first.)

00:27:38.715 --> 00:27:39.885
One, two, hook.

00:27:40.215 --> 00:27:41.355
One, two, hook.

00:27:41.855 --> 00:27:43.684
Wait. You're coming in too close.

00:27:43.685 --> 00:27:45.055
Keep a long distance.

00:27:45.155 --> 00:27:46.424
Make it long.

00:27:46.425 --> 00:27:48.124
You're getting too close now.

00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:49.325
You're wasting a bit of distance.

00:27:49.995 --> 00:27:52.995
(Ju Hyun throws a one-two, standing too close.)

00:27:53.165 --> 00:27:55.135
Like that. I want you to turn.

00:27:55.435 --> 00:27:57.705
- Oh, turn? Okay. - Yes.

00:27:57.735 --> 00:27:59.374
(I see.)

00:27:59.375 --> 00:28:01.235
Make the jab longer like a straight punch.

00:28:01.635 --> 00:28:03.605
After this, you need to turn.

00:28:03.945 --> 00:28:08.045
(She should duck to dodge punches...)

00:28:08.375 --> 00:28:09.984
Make the jab longer like a straight punch.

00:28:09.985 --> 00:28:13.985
(and turn her shoulder to make a long jab.)

00:28:14.815 --> 00:28:16.585
- Oh, turn? Okay. - Yes.

00:28:17.332 --> 00:28:18.402
Turn.

00:28:18.632 --> 00:28:19.672
Better.

00:28:19.842 --> 00:28:20.902
Again.

00:28:21.242 --> 00:28:22.272
One more.

00:28:23.042 --> 00:28:24.042
One more.

00:28:24.342 --> 00:28:25.511
That's it.

00:28:25.512 --> 00:28:26.782
(She's learned a long jab that's as strong as a straight.)

00:28:26.942 --> 00:28:28.242
That's really good.

00:28:29.042 --> 00:28:30.081
It's been a minute.

00:28:30.082 --> 00:28:31.252
(She has 1 minute left.)

00:28:31.312 --> 00:28:32.651
I'm sad that time flies.

00:28:32.652 --> 00:28:34.651
(Every minute and every second counts during the special session.)

00:28:34.652 --> 00:28:35.922
How time flies.

00:28:36.922 --> 00:28:38.021
Uppercut.

00:28:38.022 --> 00:28:39.092
Hook.

00:28:39.152 --> 00:28:40.422
You're going to go one...

00:28:40.792 --> 00:28:42.062
- That's it. - Again.

00:28:43.192 --> 00:28:44.792
- Again. - Consecutively.

00:28:45.592 --> 00:28:47.431
Your best shot is the left hook.

00:28:47.432 --> 00:28:49.061
- Left hook? - That's your best shot.

00:28:49.062 --> 00:28:50.071
- Okay? Again. - Okay.

00:28:50.072 --> 00:28:51.072
Hook.

00:28:51.402 --> 00:28:52.501
Just try a hook.

00:28:52.502 --> 00:28:55.342
(She starts upgrading her left hook.)

00:28:55.672 --> 00:28:56.841
(Turn your back.)

00:28:56.842 --> 00:28:58.172
Turn your back.

00:28:59.412 --> 00:29:00.442
Again.

00:29:00.942 --> 00:29:02.812
(Turning her back)

00:29:02.882 --> 00:29:04.881
(She performs a hook as she's taught right away.)

00:29:04.882 --> 00:29:05.911
(Before and after)

00:29:05.912 --> 00:29:07.381
Each one gets different advice.

00:29:07.382 --> 00:29:09.722
(She rotates her body in a totally different way.)

00:29:10.522 --> 00:29:12.692
(The power has changed with her new posture.)

00:29:12.922 --> 00:29:14.291
(A stronger left hook)

00:29:14.292 --> 00:29:15.361
Jab.

00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:17.562
- Her hook is really strong. - It's really good.

00:29:17.732 --> 00:29:18.831
Uppercut. Body.

00:29:18.832 --> 00:29:20.932
(10 seconds left)

00:29:21.202 --> 00:29:23.332
(Time to burn everything up with straight punches)

00:29:23.972 --> 00:29:25.132
- Two. - Harder.

00:29:25.332 --> 00:29:26.341
Two.

00:29:26.342 --> 00:29:28.372
(Squeezing out all the strength she has left)

00:29:29.072 --> 00:29:30.171
Okay.

00:29:30.172 --> 00:29:33.042
(Ju Hyun's mitt work is over.)

00:29:33.412 --> 00:29:34.781
Well done.

00:29:34.782 --> 00:29:36.582
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

00:29:36.812 --> 00:29:39.082
Your best shot is your left hook.

00:29:39.322 --> 00:29:41.021
- Left hook. - You're small,

00:29:41.022 --> 00:29:42.422
but you are very strong.

00:29:42.722 --> 00:29:44.552
So you're ready to fight next week.

00:29:45.052 --> 00:29:46.662
So you're ready to fight next week.

00:29:47.392 --> 00:29:49.491
- I'm ready too. - Good.

00:29:49.492 --> 00:29:51.631
The two minutes are really short.

00:29:51.632 --> 00:29:53.802
I know. It feels really short.

00:29:54.202 --> 00:29:55.462
- All right. - Ready.

00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:56.531
Let's go.

00:29:56.532 --> 00:29:59.232
(Next up is Sae Rok.)

00:29:59.602 --> 00:30:01.102
Jab.

00:30:01.202 --> 00:30:02.342
- Good. - Jab. One, two.

00:30:02.842 --> 00:30:05.071
One, two.

00:30:05.072 --> 00:30:06.312
One, two, hook.

00:30:07.312 --> 00:30:11.512
(Sae Rocky reacts quickly.)

00:30:11.652 --> 00:30:12.782
One, two, hook.

00:30:13.082 --> 00:30:14.321
You're very fast.

00:30:14.322 --> 00:30:15.652
Quick. It's good.

00:30:15.982 --> 00:30:18.852
(She praises Sae Rok for her speed?)

00:30:19.362 --> 00:30:22.762
(Sae Rok used to throw big punches,)

00:30:23.332 --> 00:30:28.162
(so she was too slow.)

00:30:29.002 --> 00:30:30.331
(Sae Rocky is not slow anymore.)

00:30:30.332 --> 00:30:31.432
- Sae Rok. - One, two.

00:30:33.042 --> 00:30:34.601
Her posture has changed.

00:30:34.602 --> 00:30:35.742
(The oldest member acknowledges it.)

00:30:36.072 --> 00:30:38.712
(She has only 10 seconds left.)

00:30:38.912 --> 00:30:41.741
Two.

00:30:41.742 --> 00:30:44.352
That's the ten seconds you'll never get back in your life.

00:30:44.682 --> 00:30:47.882
Two.

00:30:48.052 --> 00:30:50.751
- Gosh. Keum Sae Rok! - Two.

00:30:50.752 --> 00:30:53.392
(Stamina to maintain the crazy speed)

00:30:53.792 --> 00:30:54.822
(Groaning)

00:30:54.962 --> 00:30:58.892
- Two. - Keum Sae Rok!

00:30:58.962 --> 00:31:00.002
(Groaning)

00:31:00.062 --> 00:31:04.432
(Sae Rok burned herself for 2 minutes without regret.)

00:31:04.702 --> 00:31:08.201
(Sae Rok's mitt work is over.)

00:31:08.202 --> 00:31:09.202
Well done.

00:31:09.203 --> 00:31:10.912
We got to hear her groaning for a while in the middle.

00:31:11.312 --> 00:31:13.082
(They were glad to hear the voice.)

00:31:13.182 --> 00:31:16.211
You are the fastest out of all of them.

00:31:16.212 --> 00:31:19.081
Use your speed and fast one-twos.

00:31:19.082 --> 00:31:21.482
- Your one-twos are very fast. - Okay.

00:31:21.582 --> 00:31:24.191
Stick to that. But you lose your shape a little bit.

00:31:24.192 --> 00:31:25.921
So just stay tight.

00:31:25.922 --> 00:31:27.491
(Sae Rok's specialty is a quick one-two while maintaining distance.)

00:31:27.492 --> 00:31:28.692
- Okay? - Yes.

00:31:28.992 --> 00:31:30.162
You're ready to fight.

00:31:30.962 --> 00:31:32.261
Seriously, this is amazing.

00:31:32.262 --> 00:31:33.661
When else will I learn something like this?

00:31:33.662 --> 00:31:35.232
- Thank you. - Thank you. Well done.

00:31:35.502 --> 00:31:37.301
The precious two minutes have passed.

00:31:37.302 --> 00:31:40.341
And now, the last fighter.

00:31:40.342 --> 00:31:41.402
- Are you ready? - Yes.

00:31:41.442 --> 00:31:42.442
Ready.

00:31:42.443 --> 00:31:44.312
(The last fighter is In Ah.)

00:31:44.472 --> 00:31:46.412
Her eye is going to change.

00:31:47.212 --> 00:31:49.812
Jab.

00:31:49.982 --> 00:31:51.952
- One, two. - Everyone is good.

00:31:52.352 --> 00:31:54.381
One, two, hook.

00:31:54.382 --> 00:31:55.521
Everyone is good.

00:31:55.522 --> 00:31:57.191
(The ace's posture is exceptional.)

00:31:57.192 --> 00:31:59.051
Two.

00:31:59.052 --> 00:32:00.162
You're going to go...

00:32:00.422 --> 00:32:03.231
(Coach Shannon moves on to the weaving.)

00:32:03.232 --> 00:32:04.492
- Okay? - Two? Okay.

00:32:05.232 --> 00:32:06.761
It's been one minute.

00:32:06.762 --> 00:32:07.762
And you go...

00:32:07.763 --> 00:32:08.861
One, two.

00:32:08.862 --> 00:32:12.231
(After weaving, even the straight is stable.)

00:32:12.232 --> 00:32:14.002
Two.

00:32:15.342 --> 00:32:16.442
Good.

00:32:16.542 --> 00:32:18.372
How could she become like that after only three months?

00:32:18.512 --> 00:32:20.282
- I feel so proud when I watch her. - Two.

00:32:20.542 --> 00:32:21.582
You know what I mean?

00:32:21.812 --> 00:32:22.882
Body.

00:32:24.512 --> 00:32:26.222
- Okay. - Body.

00:32:26.682 --> 00:32:27.952
Yes. Again.

00:32:28.022 --> 00:32:29.221
- Body. - Okay.

00:32:29.222 --> 00:32:30.321
(Turning her back)

00:32:30.322 --> 00:32:32.151
- That's it. Right. - Yes. Again.

00:32:32.152 --> 00:32:35.891
(Before and after)

00:32:35.892 --> 00:32:39.662
(The weight has been shifted.)

00:32:40.462 --> 00:32:41.502
Very good.

00:32:41.662 --> 00:32:43.801
(Her body shot has been strengthened.)

00:32:43.802 --> 00:32:44.802
And this body.

00:32:44.803 --> 00:32:46.972
(Her body shot has been strengthened.)

00:32:47.442 --> 00:32:49.511
(Memorizing the skills)

00:32:49.512 --> 00:32:50.542
- That's strong. - Body.

00:32:50.772 --> 00:32:51.772
Body.

00:32:52.212 --> 00:32:53.481
That's your best shot.

00:32:53.482 --> 00:32:54.812
It's the body shot. Good.

00:32:55.342 --> 00:33:00.121
(Learning the applied technique, jab-to-body shot.)

00:33:00.122 --> 00:33:01.122
Jab.

00:33:01.123 --> 00:33:02.452
The precious last 30 seconds.

00:33:03.052 --> 00:33:04.621
(Punch through, and a body shot)

00:33:04.622 --> 00:33:05.622
And again.

00:33:05.752 --> 00:33:09.592
(Mastering the ultimate body shot)

00:33:10.232 --> 00:33:11.792
(Time left)

00:33:12.362 --> 00:33:13.401
- Two. - Ten seconds!

00:33:13.402 --> 00:33:14.962
(The precious 10 seconds!)

00:33:15.502 --> 00:33:18.802
(Time to burn everything up with straight punches)

00:33:18.972 --> 00:33:20.072
Keep going.

00:33:22.202 --> 00:33:24.672
(The speed is getting faster and faster.)

00:33:25.442 --> 00:33:28.312
(Simba Seol is carried away.)

00:33:29.682 --> 00:33:32.852
(Being pushed back)

00:33:33.222 --> 00:33:35.022
(Satisfied)

00:33:35.452 --> 00:33:37.352
(That's our ace.)

00:33:40.322 --> 00:33:44.232
(She gave it her all in the last 10 seconds.)

00:33:44.632 --> 00:33:45.791
(The mitt work is over.)

00:33:45.792 --> 00:33:47.062
- Well done. - Thank you.

00:33:47.532 --> 00:33:48.602
Well done.

00:33:49.732 --> 00:33:50.832
I'm honored.

00:33:50.872 --> 00:33:52.171
Your best shot...

00:33:52.172 --> 00:33:53.902
is your body shot.

00:33:54.272 --> 00:33:57.211
Out of all the girls, you are the neatest.

00:33:57.212 --> 00:33:58.942
It's very tidy and tight.

00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:00.882
You're ready to fight next week.

00:34:01.812 --> 00:34:03.052
Okay. Thank you.

00:34:03.682 --> 00:34:04.781
All right.

00:34:04.782 --> 00:34:05.911
We finished the mitt work.

00:34:05.912 --> 00:34:08.321
Coach, I wonder if there is a next session.

00:34:08.322 --> 00:34:09.552
The next session.

00:34:09.822 --> 00:34:11.422
You're going to spar me.

00:34:11.922 --> 00:34:13.062
But technical.

00:34:14.162 --> 00:34:15.162
(Unbelievable)

00:34:15.163 --> 00:34:16.192
Okay.

00:34:16.392 --> 00:34:18.791
The first sparring with her first students.

00:34:18.792 --> 00:34:20.232
I'm so honored.

00:34:20.262 --> 00:34:21.532
All right.

00:34:21.732 --> 00:34:23.631
While doing the mitt work with the coach,

00:34:23.632 --> 00:34:25.971
she told you the things you need to work on.

00:34:25.972 --> 00:34:28.002
I want you to remember and practice them.

00:34:28.172 --> 00:34:29.812
I'm really honored.

00:34:30.042 --> 00:34:31.342
We're honored.

00:34:31.912 --> 00:34:34.782
(The champion enters.)

00:34:35.482 --> 00:34:36.581
She looks like she belongs here.

00:34:36.582 --> 00:34:37.582
(Swift)

00:34:39.252 --> 00:34:41.081
The way she steps into the ring is so cool.

00:34:41.082 --> 00:34:42.682
I want to do the same thing.

00:34:43.352 --> 00:34:45.391
(Coach Shannon is getting ready to spar.)

00:34:45.392 --> 00:34:46.622
It has an eye on it.

00:34:46.822 --> 00:34:47.822
Eye.

00:34:47.823 --> 00:34:50.162
(Eye?)

00:34:50.362 --> 00:34:52.092
Her mouthpiece has an eye on it.

00:34:52.292 --> 00:34:54.502
So, there are three eyes looking at you.

00:34:55.532 --> 00:34:56.772
It's scary.

00:34:58.072 --> 00:34:59.232
I'm honored.

00:34:59.272 --> 00:35:00.302
Sure.

00:35:00.372 --> 00:35:01.572
- Thank you. - Good.

00:35:02.202 --> 00:35:03.572
All right.

00:35:03.672 --> 00:35:05.071
Let's begin. Box.

00:35:05.072 --> 00:35:08.142
(The supervised sparring begins.)

00:35:08.642 --> 00:35:11.782
(The skill In Ah needs to practice is her body shot.)

00:35:13.282 --> 00:35:14.881
(Trying a body shot)

00:35:14.882 --> 00:35:16.592
In Ah's posture has improved a lot.

00:35:19.622 --> 00:35:21.992
(Coach Shannon doesn't lay herself open to attack against In Ah.)

00:35:22.722 --> 00:35:24.932
(She can't keep up with her movements.)

00:35:30.402 --> 00:35:32.632
(Coach Shannon disappears before her eyes in an instant.)

00:35:32.932 --> 00:35:35.072
- She's quick. - She's really fast.

00:35:35.872 --> 00:35:36.912
She disappeared.

00:35:38.012 --> 00:35:39.142
(Another body shot)

00:35:41.342 --> 00:35:43.412
(She finally lands a body shot.)

00:35:45.482 --> 00:35:46.652
That was good.

00:35:48.722 --> 00:35:49.892
(Body shot)

00:35:50.992 --> 00:35:52.022
(Body shot 2)

00:35:52.092 --> 00:35:54.192
(Simba Seol successfully executed the advanced body shot.)

00:35:55.292 --> 00:35:58.132
(The next supervised sparring is with Sae Rok.)

00:36:01.432 --> 00:36:02.901
(Close pursuit)

00:36:02.902 --> 00:36:04.702
Nice. The coach is thrown off.

00:36:04.802 --> 00:36:05.832
That's it.

00:36:07.572 --> 00:36:08.572
Nice.

00:36:08.573 --> 00:36:09.842
(Sae Rok shows off a quick execution of the one-two.)

00:36:10.812 --> 00:36:11.912
Her one-twos are great.

00:36:12.472 --> 00:36:15.282
(Aggressively launching a fast one-two)

00:36:15.742 --> 00:36:16.781
That's it.

00:36:16.782 --> 00:36:18.412
(But Coach Shannon throws a right hook at her opening.)

00:36:19.352 --> 00:36:20.782
(Left hook)

00:36:24.722 --> 00:36:26.721
(Even though she's taking hit after hit,)

00:36:26.722 --> 00:36:28.692
(Sae Rok keeps throwing punches.)

00:36:30.592 --> 00:36:32.932
- Nice. Keep going. - Aim at her waist.

00:36:33.262 --> 00:36:35.061
- Okay. - Well done.

00:36:35.062 --> 00:36:36.632
(Sae Rok unleashed a rapid flurry of punches until the end.)

00:36:37.932 --> 00:36:39.331
(Next up is Ju Hyun)

00:36:39.332 --> 00:36:40.602
Now.

00:36:41.602 --> 00:36:43.112
Always straighten your shoulders. Throw your hooks.

00:36:44.112 --> 00:36:47.312
- Nice offense. - Yes, Ju Hyun.

00:36:48.842 --> 00:36:51.981
(She puts her newly learned long jab into action.)

00:36:51.982 --> 00:36:54.582
- Nice offense. - Yes, Ju Hyun.

00:36:56.322 --> 00:36:57.422
Long jabs. Yes.

00:36:59.152 --> 00:37:00.861
There’s an opening. Her jabs are great.

00:37:00.862 --> 00:37:02.292
(She attempts a left hook.)

00:37:02.722 --> 00:37:04.262
(Dodge)

00:37:05.062 --> 00:37:07.062
(She attempts another left hook.)

00:37:08.302 --> 00:37:10.602
(And then, she quickly evades Shannon's punch.)

00:37:12.002 --> 00:37:14.401
The champion is starting to have fun.

00:37:14.402 --> 00:37:15.502
Go!

00:37:15.942 --> 00:37:17.711
- Go! - Go!

00:37:17.712 --> 00:37:19.142
(Coach Shannon put herself in a corner so Ju Hyun could practice.)

00:37:19.672 --> 00:37:20.942
(Left hook)

00:37:23.152 --> 00:37:24.212
Nice.

00:37:26.182 --> 00:37:29.421
(Ju Hyun did her best to throw a left hook.)

00:37:29.422 --> 00:37:30.452
Well done.

00:37:30.852 --> 00:37:31.852
Give it your all.

00:37:31.853 --> 00:37:33.792
(The last one is Uie.)

00:37:35.562 --> 00:37:36.562
Body.

00:37:36.862 --> 00:37:37.931
- That's nice. - Body.

00:37:37.932 --> 00:37:41.502
(An attempt for a powerful one-two)

00:37:42.032 --> 00:37:44.772
(Uie is looking for another opening.)

00:37:46.432 --> 00:37:48.042
(Uie throws a straight.)

00:37:50.672 --> 00:37:53.582
(She struck the world champion in the face.)

00:37:54.642 --> 00:37:55.712
That's it.

00:37:57.852 --> 00:37:59.582
Gosh, that's it.

00:37:59.752 --> 00:38:00.981
Go.

00:38:00.982 --> 00:38:02.322
(The last intense stretch)

00:38:03.192 --> 00:38:05.492
Nice. Keep going.

00:38:06.122 --> 00:38:07.261
Keep going.

00:38:07.262 --> 00:38:09.221
Your opponent is taking damage. Don't stop.

00:38:09.222 --> 00:38:11.331
- Okay. - Thank you.

00:38:11.332 --> 00:38:12.532
(With Uie's turn, the training is complete.)

00:38:13.062 --> 00:38:14.532
Okay.

00:38:15.702 --> 00:38:17.031
That was nice.

00:38:17.032 --> 00:38:19.071
- I'm so grateful. - Good.

00:38:19.072 --> 00:38:20.471
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:38:20.472 --> 00:38:24.911
We spent a fun day today training with Coach Shannon,

00:38:24.912 --> 00:38:26.271
the number one world champion.

00:38:26.272 --> 00:38:27.581
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

00:38:27.582 --> 00:38:29.382
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

00:38:29.582 --> 00:38:32.451
The one who listens to what I'm telling them...

00:38:32.452 --> 00:38:35.181
and does what I taught them on the pads earlier.

00:38:35.182 --> 00:38:36.281
You get the prize.

00:38:36.282 --> 00:38:38.192
(You get the prize.)

00:38:38.522 --> 00:38:39.721
- It's an honor. - You did great.

00:38:39.722 --> 00:38:44.092
She said she would pick one person as today's MVP.

00:38:44.362 --> 00:38:45.391
Who is it?

00:38:45.392 --> 00:38:48.601
Okay. You've all been fantastic, but my MVP...

00:38:48.602 --> 00:38:51.572
(Who will the champion choose as today's MVP?)

00:38:52.202 --> 00:38:53.272
is In Ah.

00:38:54.172 --> 00:38:55.701
I knew it.

00:38:55.702 --> 00:38:57.512
(Today's MVP is Simba Seol.)

00:38:57.772 --> 00:38:59.141
I knew it.

00:38:59.142 --> 00:39:00.681
I knew it.

00:39:00.682 --> 00:39:01.741
- I knew it. - In Ah.

00:39:01.742 --> 00:39:02.981
She chose In Ah.

00:39:02.982 --> 00:39:04.082
(Congratulations)

00:39:04.412 --> 00:39:06.411
- How do you feel? - My hand has been raised.

00:39:06.412 --> 00:39:08.022
My hand has been raised.

00:39:08.922 --> 00:39:10.791
Because she listened the most.

00:39:10.792 --> 00:39:13.562
She was very quicker than me on the ladders.

00:39:13.922 --> 00:39:16.661
And in sparring, she did what I taught her to do.

00:39:16.662 --> 00:39:19.261
And very fast, as well.

00:39:19.262 --> 00:39:20.431
- Very good. - Thank you.

00:39:20.432 --> 00:39:22.561
Fighters can tell who's a real fighter.

00:39:22.562 --> 00:39:23.701
They can really tell.

00:39:23.702 --> 00:39:24.702
(Fighters recognize fighters.)

00:39:24.832 --> 00:39:26.641
- What is it? - Is that a gift?

00:39:26.642 --> 00:39:28.302
(It's time for the gifts.)

00:39:28.372 --> 00:39:29.842
(Excited)

00:39:30.212 --> 00:39:31.441
I'm so jealous.

00:39:31.442 --> 00:39:33.112
You go stand here.

00:39:33.612 --> 00:39:35.211
- I'm not going to look. - You go stand here.

00:39:35.212 --> 00:39:36.542
Stand over here.

00:39:36.912 --> 00:39:37.952
(Screaming)

00:39:40.922 --> 00:39:41.982
Oh, my gosh.

00:39:42.182 --> 00:39:44.151
These are autographed gloves.

00:39:44.152 --> 00:39:46.051
(A pair of gloves with the champion's autograph)

00:39:46.052 --> 00:39:47.291
- I'm jealous. - She'll be an amateur fighter.

00:39:47.292 --> 00:39:48.992
I'm really jealous.

00:39:49.122 --> 00:39:50.692
I'll never stop boxing.

00:39:51.392 --> 00:39:52.762
Thank you.

00:39:52.992 --> 00:39:55.702
Well done.

00:39:55.902 --> 00:39:58.832
You three are going to get my t-shirts signed as well.

00:39:59.202 --> 00:40:03.172
(The three Iron Girls will get autographed t-shirts too.)

00:40:05.542 --> 00:40:06.982
Thank you.

00:40:08.342 --> 00:40:10.382
- This is so pretty. - Thank you.

00:40:11.082 --> 00:40:12.882
- Thank you. - Does she only have three?

00:40:15.352 --> 00:40:16.582
Does she only have three?

00:40:19.092 --> 00:40:22.062
I'm your student. Please.

00:40:22.822 --> 00:40:24.031
This is so pretty.

00:40:24.032 --> 00:40:25.662
Thank you.

00:40:27.432 --> 00:40:29.201
- The energy of the world champion. - Right.

00:40:29.202 --> 00:40:32.032
- May it dwell within us. - I can feel it inspiring us.

00:40:32.332 --> 00:40:34.242
Thank you so much.

00:40:35.202 --> 00:40:36.541
It's not much,

00:40:36.542 --> 00:40:38.072
but we've prepared a gift for you too.

00:40:38.172 --> 00:40:39.671
- What is it? - The Iron Girls prepared...

00:40:39.672 --> 00:40:40.781
Korean snacks.

00:40:40.782 --> 00:40:43.041
- Korean traditional snacks. - Korean snacks.

00:40:43.042 --> 00:40:44.081
Korean seaweed crisps.

00:40:44.082 --> 00:40:46.082
We brought Korean seaweed crisps as a gift for you.

00:40:46.312 --> 00:40:48.651
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

00:40:48.652 --> 00:40:50.792
I love seaweed. Thank you very much.

00:40:50.822 --> 00:40:52.292
You can eat them by themselves.

00:40:52.492 --> 00:40:54.692
You can eat them by themselves or you can eat them with your meal.

00:40:55.622 --> 00:40:56.892
Seaweed.

00:40:58.192 --> 00:41:00.162
These are snacks made with seaweed.

00:41:00.662 --> 00:41:02.032
Do you like it?

00:41:02.762 --> 00:41:04.272
We said these were for her.

00:41:06.602 --> 00:41:08.802
- These are so crispy. - They're crispy and tasty.

00:41:09.242 --> 00:41:10.672
These go well with beer.

00:41:10.812 --> 00:41:12.671
The seaweed itself is good quality,

00:41:12.672 --> 00:41:14.111
- so the crisps have a rich flavor. - Yes.

00:41:14.112 --> 00:41:17.382
I want to hear from the Iron Girls.

00:41:17.482 --> 00:41:20.081
The competition is right around the corner.

00:41:20.082 --> 00:41:21.982
No matter who our opponent is,

00:41:22.422 --> 00:41:24.721
I feel like I would think, "Come on."

00:41:24.722 --> 00:41:28.091
"I did supervised sparring with the world champion."

00:41:28.092 --> 00:41:30.761
So I'm grateful for this precious experience.

00:41:30.762 --> 00:41:32.562
- Thank you so much. - That's nice.

00:41:33.192 --> 00:41:36.001
I felt my blood boil today.

00:41:36.002 --> 00:41:37.572
"I want to be like her."

00:41:37.772 --> 00:41:39.702
That thought was in my head the whole time,

00:41:39.832 --> 00:41:41.571
so I think this would motivate me to work even harder.

00:41:41.572 --> 00:41:43.772
Thank you for inspiring me.

00:41:44.372 --> 00:41:45.911
All I'm going to say to you is,

00:41:45.912 --> 00:41:49.012
you've done all the hard work already. Enjoy yourself.

00:41:49.382 --> 00:41:51.252
- Okay. - Thank you so much.

00:41:51.352 --> 00:41:52.911
(A special training session with the world champion)

00:41:52.912 --> 00:41:54.022
Thank you.

00:41:55.852 --> 00:41:57.592
What do you think we're having for dinner?

00:41:57.692 --> 00:41:58.891
Pu pad pong karee.

00:41:58.892 --> 00:42:00.021
- What? Today... - Is it pu pad pong karee?

00:42:00.022 --> 00:42:02.691
We prepared everything you wanted to eat.

00:42:02.692 --> 00:42:04.091
- Even stir-fried morning glory? - For real?

00:42:04.092 --> 00:42:05.932
- Can we trust you? - For real.

00:42:06.292 --> 00:42:07.731
This is actually a popular restaurant.

00:42:07.732 --> 00:42:09.101
(Did Captain Kim really bring them to a famous local spot?)

00:42:09.102 --> 00:42:10.402
Look at this view.

00:42:10.532 --> 00:42:13.232
- Gosh. - Gosh, this is nice.

00:42:13.502 --> 00:42:16.141
- Gosh. - The view is beautiful.

00:42:16.142 --> 00:42:17.941
- What? - What?

00:42:17.942 --> 00:42:19.071
- Goodness. - What is this?

00:42:19.072 --> 00:42:20.912
- This is amazing. - Is this a honeymoon hot spot?

00:42:21.012 --> 00:42:23.682
It finally feels like we're in Phuket.

00:42:23.812 --> 00:42:25.052
- Gosh. - This is beautiful.

00:42:25.152 --> 00:42:26.181
I love this ambience.

00:42:26.182 --> 00:42:27.821
How is this place so beautiful?

00:42:27.822 --> 00:42:29.421
- The vibe is amazing. - It really is.

00:42:29.422 --> 00:42:32.592
(Located on Rawai Beach in southern Phuket)

00:42:34.722 --> 00:42:36.831
(Rawai Beach is known for its beautiful sunsets.)

00:42:36.832 --> 00:42:38.491
How is this place so beautiful?

00:42:38.492 --> 00:42:40.201
- The vibe is amazing. - It really is.

00:42:40.202 --> 00:42:42.061
- It's breathtaking. - It's incredible.

00:42:42.062 --> 00:42:45.101
I ordered all the food I know you'll like...

00:42:45.102 --> 00:42:47.971
and the foods that are locally famous in Thailand.

00:42:47.972 --> 00:42:49.001
(He ordered famous local food.)

00:42:49.002 --> 00:42:50.841
- Is this real? - It is.

00:42:50.842 --> 00:42:52.671
- I feel like he's lying. - Why do you keep saying I'm lying?

00:42:52.672 --> 00:42:55.011
Are we back in protein land?

00:42:55.012 --> 00:42:57.211
- No. - What's wrong with you?

00:42:57.212 --> 00:42:59.351
- Are they making protein shakes? - Seriously, is this...

00:42:59.352 --> 00:43:01.051
They must be using the blender right now.

00:43:01.052 --> 00:43:02.751
This is so disappointing.

00:43:02.752 --> 00:43:04.491
Just give us our protein already.

00:43:04.492 --> 00:43:05.951
- Over there. - The food's here.

00:43:05.952 --> 00:43:07.291
- I see something. - What is it?

00:43:07.292 --> 00:43:09.421
- The food's here. - It's here.

00:43:09.422 --> 00:43:10.832
(They're half worried, half excited. What is the dish?)

00:43:12.132 --> 00:43:13.332
Curry powder.

00:43:14.332 --> 00:43:16.102
- What is it? - Is this pu pad pong karee?

00:43:16.562 --> 00:43:18.731
Chicken. This is really good.

00:43:18.732 --> 00:43:19.772
- Good food. - Yes.

00:43:20.402 --> 00:43:22.442
- Gosh. - Shrimp!

00:43:24.072 --> 00:43:25.211
(Thai glass noodle salad, yam wun sen)

00:43:25.212 --> 00:43:26.411
Gosh. Thank you.

00:43:26.412 --> 00:43:27.841
You were right. Lobsters!

00:43:27.842 --> 00:43:29.911
- Over here, please. - It's a real lobster.

00:43:29.912 --> 00:43:31.182
It's a real lobster.

00:43:31.682 --> 00:43:33.281
- It's a real lobster. - Gosh.

00:43:33.282 --> 00:43:35.821
(It's a real grilled lobster with cheese on top.)

00:43:35.822 --> 00:43:36.852
Okay.

00:43:37.292 --> 00:43:39.322
Pad Thai!

00:43:39.592 --> 00:43:42.221
- Pad Thai! - Pad Thai!

00:43:42.222 --> 00:43:43.731
This is the best.

00:43:43.732 --> 00:43:45.092
(The most famous stir-fried noodle dish in Thailand, pad Thai)

00:43:45.162 --> 00:43:47.132
Why are you being so nice to us?

00:43:47.332 --> 00:43:48.532
- What's going on? - What is this?

00:43:48.832 --> 00:43:50.171
(Another dish is being brought out mysteriously.)

00:43:50.172 --> 00:43:51.601
- Tom yum kung. - Tom yum kung?

00:43:51.602 --> 00:43:54.071
- Gosh, it's tom yum kung. - I love tom yum kung.

00:43:54.072 --> 00:43:55.342
- I've never seen it like this. - Me too.

00:43:55.902 --> 00:43:57.471
I guess they're doing something with this.

00:43:57.472 --> 00:43:59.112
Let's watch the performance.

00:43:59.712 --> 00:44:00.912
I guess they're putting on a show.

00:44:01.412 --> 00:44:03.041
Why is she turning it on? What is she trying to do?

00:44:03.042 --> 00:44:04.052
(She turns on the torch.)

00:44:04.367 --> 00:44:05.637
I guess they're putting on a show.

00:44:06.097 --> 00:44:07.937
Why is she turning it on? What is she trying to do?

00:44:08.837 --> 00:44:10.036
Will the glass not blow up?

00:44:10.037 --> 00:44:11.106
(She heats up the glass with the tom yum kung inside.)

00:44:11.107 --> 00:44:12.577
- It's moving up. - Gosh. It's moving up.

00:44:14.107 --> 00:44:15.146
It's moving up.

00:44:15.147 --> 00:44:16.476
(The broth on the bottom is moved up.)

00:44:16.477 --> 00:44:17.976
- It keeps moving up. - It keeps moving up.

00:44:17.977 --> 00:44:18.977
This is amazing.

00:44:19.117 --> 00:44:20.246
I'm worried it's going to blow up.

00:44:20.247 --> 00:44:21.616
(The broth is infused with the aroma of the spices.)

00:44:21.617 --> 00:44:22.747
- Infusing the broth. - Gosh.

00:44:22.917 --> 00:44:23.957
It's hot. Be careful.

00:44:24.657 --> 00:44:25.956
(Move the infused broth down the glass pipe again.)

00:44:25.957 --> 00:44:27.226
- She's moving it down again. - She's moving it down again.

00:44:27.227 --> 00:44:28.487
What? And then...

00:44:29.657 --> 00:44:30.726
And then...

00:44:30.727 --> 00:44:32.196
(The dish is complete when the broth is poured into...)

00:44:32.197 --> 00:44:33.256
(a plate with the ingredients.)

00:44:33.257 --> 00:44:34.826
I’ve never had tom yum kung served this way before.

00:44:34.827 --> 00:44:36.797
- Me neither. - Look at the quality.

00:44:37.337 --> 00:44:39.296
(A unique local tom yum kung)

00:44:39.297 --> 00:44:41.007
- Thank you. - Enjoy your dinner.

00:44:41.067 --> 00:44:42.766
(Enjoy your meal.)

00:44:42.767 --> 00:44:44.637
- Thank you for the food. - She said we could eat.

00:44:44.737 --> 00:44:45.777
(Gosh!)

00:44:46.007 --> 00:44:47.206
I'm really losing it.

00:44:47.207 --> 00:44:48.847
We really need to take pictures.

00:44:49.807 --> 00:44:52.646
- I'm so happy. - Finally, it feels like Thailand.

00:44:52.647 --> 00:44:54.616
- Gosh. This looks good. - We're finally having Thai food.

00:44:54.617 --> 00:44:56.187
I'm having Thai food.

00:44:56.217 --> 00:44:57.356
This looks so good.

00:44:57.357 --> 00:44:58.556
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

00:44:58.557 --> 00:44:59.917
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy.

00:45:00.057 --> 00:45:01.256
This nice view...

00:45:01.257 --> 00:45:02.456
and this good food.

00:45:02.457 --> 00:45:03.486
(She takes a huge bite.)

00:45:03.487 --> 00:45:04.557
It's so good.

00:45:05.357 --> 00:45:08.827
(Shocked)

00:45:10.397 --> 00:45:12.067
- It's so good. - Enjoy.

00:45:16.667 --> 00:45:17.807
Let's have one more of this.

00:45:22.347 --> 00:45:23.477
This is so good.

00:45:24.077 --> 00:45:25.177
It's good.

00:45:28.847 --> 00:45:29.917
Let me hold that for you.

00:45:31.517 --> 00:45:33.727
- I thought no one would do this. - Like this.

00:45:35.027 --> 00:45:36.526
Eat. Take the one you cut up.

00:45:36.527 --> 00:45:38.227
- Eat it. Put it in your mouth. - Eat that one.

00:45:38.527 --> 00:45:39.827
It's so good.

00:45:40.467 --> 00:45:41.666
(She puts it in her mouth.)

00:45:41.667 --> 00:45:42.667
(Gosh)

00:45:43.267 --> 00:45:44.867
This is so good.

00:45:48.567 --> 00:45:52.037
(Today's feast is absolutely satisfying.)

00:45:52.307 --> 00:45:53.807
Let me try the tom yum kung.

00:45:54.777 --> 00:45:59.217
(How will the tom yum kung with the fancy performance taste?)

00:46:00.317 --> 00:46:01.317
(Gosh)

00:46:01.318 --> 00:46:02.387
How is it?

00:46:02.747 --> 00:46:04.017
- Is it legit? - Yes.

00:46:04.617 --> 00:46:05.687
The tom yum kung.

00:46:07.457 --> 00:46:09.826
(Flavors that make you forget all the fatigue.)

00:46:09.827 --> 00:46:11.856
- This must be a really good place. - Indeed.

00:46:11.857 --> 00:46:13.897
Doesn't it explain it all if their tom yum kung is good?

00:46:13.927 --> 00:46:15.427
Even their cola is pretty.

00:46:18.267 --> 00:46:20.437
My impression of Thailand is getting better.

00:46:21.067 --> 00:46:22.336
It had been tough only for us.

00:46:22.337 --> 00:46:23.907
Why are we so basic?

00:46:24.177 --> 00:46:25.437
- As long as we're fed... - As long as we're fed...

00:46:25.507 --> 00:46:26.936
As long as the food is good...

00:46:26.937 --> 00:46:28.877
Food makes everything right.

00:46:30.107 --> 00:46:31.116
(Uie, who needs to bulk up...)

00:46:31.117 --> 00:46:32.277
This is so good.

00:46:32.917 --> 00:46:34.016
It's so good.

00:46:34.017 --> 00:46:35.086
Help yourself.

00:46:35.087 --> 00:46:36.516
(Her chopsticks...)

00:46:36.517 --> 00:46:38.587
Who wants some fried rice?

00:46:39.257 --> 00:46:41.756
I think this is a really good Thai restaurant.

00:46:41.757 --> 00:46:45.957
(Unstoppable)

00:46:46.257 --> 00:46:48.167
Uie looks very happy, which is so cute.

00:46:48.597 --> 00:46:50.467
I really love Thai food.

00:46:51.567 --> 00:46:58.377
(The Iron Girls trained hard, so they fuel up properly.)

00:46:59.037 --> 00:47:00.607
But seriously,

00:47:00.747 --> 00:47:02.646
I often go on training camps...

00:47:02.647 --> 00:47:04.677
with this many members of other athletes,

00:47:04.877 --> 00:47:06.047
and you guys eat more than they do.

00:47:06.477 --> 00:47:07.516
- Don't lie. - I'm serious.

00:47:07.517 --> 00:47:08.646
- Don't lie. - Don't lie.

00:47:08.647 --> 00:47:10.116
More than five men?

00:47:10.117 --> 00:47:11.186
- Captain. - Yes?

00:47:11.187 --> 00:47:12.416
If word gets out, it's you.

00:47:12.417 --> 00:47:13.857
Alright. I get it.

00:47:14.487 --> 00:47:15.527
But...

00:47:15.627 --> 00:47:16.927
You really are like athletes.

00:47:16.987 --> 00:47:18.427
You don't say a word.

00:47:18.627 --> 00:47:19.727
We ate too quickly again.

00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.227
I know.

00:47:21.527 --> 00:47:23.227
- I'm so full. - We're in trouble.

00:47:23.327 --> 00:47:24.597
But seriously,

00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:26.166
did you ever think you'd meet...

00:47:26.167 --> 00:47:28.066
the world boxing champion in Phuket?

00:47:28.067 --> 00:47:29.637
- No way. - Never.

00:47:30.107 --> 00:47:32.106
And it's our first time seeing the belt...

00:47:32.107 --> 00:47:33.206
- for us. - Yes.

00:47:33.207 --> 00:47:35.106
- It was so heavy. - Yes.

00:47:35.107 --> 00:47:36.146
It’s a symbol of success.

00:47:36.147 --> 00:47:39.046
The top rank in the world.

00:47:39.047 --> 00:47:40.387
It’s the honor of the family.

00:47:40.447 --> 00:47:42.786
You now have nine days until the competition.

00:47:42.787 --> 00:47:44.056
- Yes, sir. - Yes.

00:47:44.057 --> 00:47:45.116
Now,

00:47:45.117 --> 00:47:47.186
with more sparring experience, are you used to it?

00:47:47.187 --> 00:47:48.286
How do you feel about it?

00:47:48.287 --> 00:47:50.226
- It's... - I'm not as anxious as before,

00:47:50.227 --> 00:47:53.926
but I still have enough excitement and tension.

00:47:53.927 --> 00:47:56.766
What I practiced during training...

00:47:56.767 --> 00:47:59.037
didn't come out perfectly in execution,

00:47:59.167 --> 00:48:00.506
and I couldn't perform it...

00:48:00.507 --> 00:48:02.437
- during the actual match. - When your body doesn't follow?

00:48:02.567 --> 00:48:04.206
I can't sleep at night...

00:48:04.207 --> 00:48:05.506
after having an actual sparring session.

00:48:05.507 --> 00:48:07.376
- Because of stress? - That too,

00:48:07.377 --> 00:48:09.006
and I spend about three hours monitoring the recording,

00:48:09.007 --> 00:48:10.306
when it's only a three-minute clip.

00:48:10.307 --> 00:48:11.516
(She spent 3 hours monitoring the 3-minute match!)

00:48:11.517 --> 00:48:13.346
- Is that so? - That's so...

00:48:13.347 --> 00:48:15.246
What you just said is the same stress I had...

00:48:15.247 --> 00:48:16.917
back when I was an athlete.

00:48:17.157 --> 00:48:19.956
You grow because you have that stress.

00:48:19.957 --> 00:48:22.227
But I wish you wouldn't get so stressed.

00:48:22.357 --> 00:48:23.756
You don't even know how much experience...

00:48:23.757 --> 00:48:24.856
your opponent will have,

00:48:24.857 --> 00:48:26.596
but the fact that you can go up there and fight...

00:48:26.597 --> 00:48:29.266
- You're right. - makes you a winner already.

00:48:29.267 --> 00:48:32.497
You overcame such amazing things.

00:48:32.637 --> 00:48:35.036
No matter who comes, let's have a great match.

00:48:35.037 --> 00:48:36.266
I think I will also feel like...

00:48:36.267 --> 00:48:37.476
- I had done my best. - Right.

00:48:37.477 --> 00:48:39.736
That's what Boxer Ae Ji said last time.

00:48:39.737 --> 00:48:41.546
"If I outdid myself from yesterday, that’s enough."

00:48:41.547 --> 00:48:42.777
- Yes, that's right. - Yes.

00:48:42.807 --> 00:48:43.816
Give it your all.

00:48:43.817 --> 00:48:44.817
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:48:44.818 --> 00:48:46.246
- I’m confident about that. - So that you have no regrets.

00:48:46.247 --> 00:48:47.247
That's how we will prepare.

00:48:47.247 --> 00:48:48.247
Let's do this.

00:48:48.248 --> 00:48:49.686
- Good job. - Good job.

00:48:49.687 --> 00:48:51.886
Thank you. Today was yet another long day.

00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:53.257
(The Phuket Boot Camp is over.)

00:48:53.827 --> 00:48:56.727
(How did they spend the 2 weeks before their first competition?)

00:48:56.927 --> 00:48:59.256
Okay. Let's go. Start.

00:48:59.257 --> 00:49:01.667
(In Ah, Sae Rok)

00:49:02.067 --> 00:49:04.796
(Arm-working training for upper body muscle strengthening)

00:49:04.797 --> 00:49:06.297
- You're doing great. - You're doing great.

00:49:06.367 --> 00:49:07.606
(In Ah)

00:49:07.607 --> 00:49:11.406
(For Iron Muscle In Ah,)

00:49:11.407 --> 00:49:15.047
(she even does push-ups.)

00:49:15.807 --> 00:49:17.776
Gosh. She's amazing. Good job.

00:49:17.777 --> 00:49:18.816
(Sae Rok)

00:49:18.817 --> 00:49:23.817
(As the competition nears, the training gets more intense.)

00:49:23.917 --> 00:49:24.986
(Uie)

00:49:24.987 --> 00:49:26.816
(The Iron Girls are steadily pushing through.)

00:49:26.817 --> 00:49:28.657
Okay. Good job.

00:49:29.027 --> 00:49:32.357
(They check their muscles after the workout.)

00:49:37.367 --> 00:49:38.896
(The sparring training is done at high intensity.)

00:49:38.897 --> 00:49:40.907
You need to bounce up and down.

00:49:42.237 --> 00:49:44.776
(His radar is on.)

00:49:44.777 --> 00:49:46.076
- Above. - Both of you...

00:49:46.077 --> 00:49:47.307
have no impact in your punches.

00:49:47.747 --> 00:49:49.147
What I can do...

00:49:49.707 --> 00:49:51.677
- is this. - That's it. That's how you do it.

00:49:52.147 --> 00:49:53.847
- She might get hurt. - It's okay.

00:49:54.017 --> 00:49:56.217
It won't hurt even if she gets hit like that.

00:49:56.247 --> 00:49:58.117
- You need to be precise. - Let's do it.

00:49:58.357 --> 00:49:59.617
The match is in two days.

00:49:59.687 --> 00:50:02.287
Your opponent will come at you to finish you.

00:50:02.457 --> 00:50:03.656
You need to be like that.

00:50:03.657 --> 00:50:05.627
(As the competition nears, the sparring is done realistically.)

00:50:06.027 --> 00:50:07.226
(Ju Hyun, Uie)

00:50:07.227 --> 00:50:10.027
(They actively train while supporting each other.)

00:50:10.267 --> 00:50:11.337
That's it.

00:50:11.467 --> 00:50:12.537
I can't reach you.

00:50:12.867 --> 00:50:14.607
You did reach me.

00:50:15.407 --> 00:50:17.106
(Ju Hyun's training log: I tried to overcome Uie's reach,)

00:50:17.107 --> 00:50:18.936
(but I only ended up straining my neck.)

00:50:18.937 --> 00:50:21.376
(You can't overcome the reach.)

00:50:21.377 --> 00:50:24.077
(You just keep going in while taking the blows!)

00:50:24.717 --> 00:50:26.646
(I had an intense workout session for 3 hours,)

00:50:26.647 --> 00:50:27.916
(before heading to the show.)

00:50:27.917 --> 00:50:29.946
(My arms, hands, and even my eyes are trembling.)

00:50:29.947 --> 00:50:33.517
(I almost even drooled.)

00:50:33.657 --> 00:50:34.726
(Uie)

00:50:34.727 --> 00:50:39.427
(The Iron Girls are using their time to grow even further.)

00:50:39.857 --> 00:50:43.197
(This person even came to the gym twice a day.)

00:50:43.567 --> 00:50:47.336
(It's In Ah.)

00:50:47.337 --> 00:50:51.877
I am wearing my sweat suit and preparing to jump rope.

00:50:53.077 --> 00:50:54.147
(Groaning)

00:50:56.747 --> 00:51:00.517
(The reason she is working so hard...)

00:51:01.187 --> 00:51:04.587
(The crucial hurdle for the first competition)

00:51:05.557 --> 00:51:08.687
(Preparing for the weigh-in.)

00:51:09.627 --> 00:51:11.356
(In order to get on the ring,)

00:51:11.357 --> 00:51:14.167
(they need to meet the weight class.)

00:51:14.727 --> 00:51:16.126
(In order to optimize their body condition,)

00:51:16.127 --> 00:51:17.667
(considering their height, muscle mass, and more,)

00:51:18.037 --> 00:51:20.607
(weight management is crucial.)

00:51:20.767 --> 00:51:24.577
(So the Iron Girls set their target weight class.)

00:51:24.907 --> 00:51:29.447
(Uie, 30s Division, Under 54kg)

00:51:30.147 --> 00:51:34.487
(Uie's goal is to gain 1.6kg while increasing muscle mass.)

00:51:34.887 --> 00:51:37.687
(Sae Rok, 30s Division, Under 54kg)

00:51:38.287 --> 00:51:41.057
(Sae Rok's goal is to gain 0.8kg while reducing body fat.)

00:51:41.457 --> 00:51:46.057
(Ju Hyun, 30s Division, Under 51kg)

00:51:46.497 --> 00:51:52.737
(Ju Hyun's goal is to lose 2.9kg while consuming carbohydrates.)

00:51:53.137 --> 00:51:55.667
(In Ah, 20s Division, Under 54kg)

00:51:56.207 --> 00:52:01.447
(In Ah's goal is to lose 2.7kg while doing cardio exercises.)

00:52:01.777 --> 00:52:04.946
(In Ah has 26kg of skeletal muscle mass...)

00:52:04.947 --> 00:52:08.647
(and only 10kg of body fat.)

00:52:09.247 --> 00:52:12.657
(But she still started the 2.6kg weight reduction.)

00:52:12.917 --> 00:52:14.587
(She came twice a day.)

00:52:15.087 --> 00:52:16.756
(Boxing training)

00:52:16.757 --> 00:52:18.227
(Sparring training)

00:52:18.597 --> 00:52:20.496
(And she even did cardio with a sweat suit on.)

00:52:20.497 --> 00:52:22.327
(Sweat suit)

00:52:24.267 --> 00:52:28.667
(Massive training load)

00:52:29.367 --> 00:52:30.506
(In Ah's training log: During my 1-hour run,)

00:52:30.507 --> 00:52:32.106
(I felt like 8 versions of myself appeared inside,)

00:52:32.107 --> 00:52:33.906
(saying "give up, don't give up, good job", and others,)

00:52:33.907 --> 00:52:36.646
(and then it was over.)

00:52:36.647 --> 00:52:38.477
(Of course, it felt like 3 hours.)

00:52:38.747 --> 00:52:39.816
That's it.

00:52:39.817 --> 00:52:41.316
(It felt good to train outside after a long time.)

00:52:41.317 --> 00:52:43.916
(When will I ever work this hard at something again?)

00:52:43.917 --> 00:52:46.186
(Have I ever been this obsessed before?)

00:52:46.187 --> 00:52:49.056
(Lying down afterwards and looking up at the sky,)

00:52:49.057 --> 00:52:51.627
(I felt an indescribable feeling.)

00:52:52.457 --> 00:52:55.627
I may whine about how hard it is, but deep down, it's actually fun.

00:52:56.167 --> 00:53:00.537
I don’t think I’ve ever been this crazy for something.

00:53:02.937 --> 00:53:04.476
I don't come here because I have to.

00:53:04.477 --> 00:53:05.876
I come because I enjoy it.

00:53:05.877 --> 00:53:07.277
(I don't come because I have to, but because I enjoy it.)

00:53:07.677 --> 00:53:09.646
(All of this will be a valuable experience...)

00:53:09.647 --> 00:53:11.676
(that will become my blood and flesh.)

00:53:11.677 --> 00:53:14.447
(I will do my best so that I have no regrets even if I die tomorrow.)

00:53:14.947 --> 00:53:18.487
(And another weight-loss member, Ju Hyun)

00:53:18.857 --> 00:53:20.616
(Since she had no time, she did cardio...)

00:53:20.617 --> 00:53:22.487
(with the sweat suit on, after her theater show.)

00:53:22.857 --> 00:53:24.096
(Ju Hyun's training log: After the show,)

00:53:24.097 --> 00:53:25.996
(all I can do is jump rope and run in my sweat suit.)

00:53:25.997 --> 00:53:28.096
(The unbearably hot weather is helping me.)

00:53:28.097 --> 00:53:29.997
(People get scared of me when I run at night.)

00:53:30.297 --> 00:53:31.737
In order to lose weight,

00:53:32.597 --> 00:53:35.667
I am in my sweat suit and running by the Han River.

00:53:36.637 --> 00:53:39.306
(Before the show,)

00:53:39.307 --> 00:53:42.077
(and after the show)

00:53:42.307 --> 00:53:45.617
(She keeps working out whenever and wherever she has the time.)

00:53:46.517 --> 00:53:48.516
(She keeps up with her carb intake, which was another goal for her.)

00:53:48.517 --> 00:53:50.647
(Banana)

00:53:52.787 --> 00:53:56.327
(Frequently eating bananas)

00:53:56.827 --> 00:53:58.426
I think I might turn into a monkey.

00:53:58.427 --> 00:54:00.427
(I think I might turn into a monkey.)

00:54:00.827 --> 00:54:02.066
(Ju Hyun's training log: I can't sleep...)

00:54:02.067 --> 00:54:03.666
(because I'm too hungry.)

00:54:03.667 --> 00:54:05.936
(Working out to lose weight is so hard that I'm crying.)

00:54:05.937 --> 00:54:08.366
(After the weigh-in, what should I eat to make it fully satisfying?)

00:54:08.367 --> 00:54:10.837
(Tteokbokki, pizza, jjajangmyeon, pasta, gukbap, stir-fried pork...)

00:54:11.537 --> 00:54:12.736
Let's overcome this.

00:54:12.737 --> 00:54:14.146
(The competition is nearing.)

00:54:14.147 --> 00:54:15.576
(I need to do my best to have no regrets.)

00:54:15.577 --> 00:54:16.746
(Let's endure it a bit more. I can do this!)

00:54:16.747 --> 00:54:18.117
It's not long until the competition.

00:54:18.647 --> 00:54:19.746
Let's go.

00:54:19.747 --> 00:54:21.387
(She stays positive even despite the tough training.)

00:54:21.487 --> 00:54:22.487
Nine.

00:54:22.488 --> 00:54:24.857
(On the other hand, Uie's goal is to increase muscle mass.)

00:54:25.317 --> 00:54:29.327
(She focuses on gaining weight through strength training.)

00:54:29.957 --> 00:54:33.157
(But...)

00:54:33.627 --> 00:54:37.797
I noticed that you lose fat too quickly.

00:54:37.867 --> 00:54:38.897
I know.

00:54:39.537 --> 00:54:40.837
It's very fast.

00:54:42.067 --> 00:54:43.266
How much do you weigh right now?

00:54:43.267 --> 00:54:45.107
I'm 51kg right now.

00:54:45.677 --> 00:54:46.737
You're 51kg right now?

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:48.439
How much do you weigh right now?

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.370
I'm 51kg right now.

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:52.710
- You're 51kg right now? - I checked this morning.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:57.550
(Since she worked 3 to 4 hours every day,)

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.720
(Uie lost 1kg of body fat.)

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:06.360
(It's a serious situation where she could be below the weight standard.)

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.129
(Worried)

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:10.560
(On eggshells)

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.430
I'll try to eat well.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.200
- Eat a lot of carbs. - Okay.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.139
(She begins eating to bulk up.)

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.540
(Pork belly)

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:24.680
(Meat is always delicious.)

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:26.740
Dinner tonight is...

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:29.750
sushi.

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.580
Coach Ji Hoon recommended sushi.

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:38.660
(Eating a lot to gain weight)

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.490
(An egg toast for a snack after 1 hour)

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:44.260
Since I try to eat a lot,

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:47.600
the number is going up.

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.570
(Will Uie be able to gain weight?)

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:57.580
(Meanwhile, Sae Rok agreed to reduce her body fat.)

00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:07.320
(She plays all over the boxing gym and trains hard.)

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:09.949
(Sae Rok's training log:)

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:11.459
(I can hit the sandbag for 2 minutes for 10 rounds?)

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:13.689
(I never got to hit it without taking any breaks.)

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:16.490
(Now, I got the skills to hit it nonstop!)

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:19.059
(Upon getting ready to meet the weight,)

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:23.500
(Rocky's stamina also increased.)

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.470
(And)

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:29.840
(Their uniform for their first tournament arrived.)

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.110
I'm so nervous.

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:35.209
Oh, I thought this would be a t-shirt.

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:36.650
I'm so nervous!

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:42.120
(Getting more excited and nervous after putting on the uniform)

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.060
(Ju Hyun got changed as soon as she received it.)

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.890
(The Max Boxer is ready.)

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.230
(Bring it on.)

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:52.829
(Iron Girls are becoming real boxers.)

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:54.100
This is our uniform.

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:55.930
It feels different to put it on.

00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:57.200
Yes. It's new.

00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:59.640
We're really entering the tournament.

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:01.910
Seoul.

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.740
Iron Girls!

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.550
- That's so cool. - Right?

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.020
One, two.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:15.790
You got it. Yes.

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:18.160
Two, one.

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:26.400
(The day of the first tournament)

00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:29.900
(Seoul Sports Council)

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:35.940
(The weight center is crowded with people who are here to register.)

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:40.879
This is so...

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.510
(Sighing)

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:44.920
- Hello. - Hello.

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.719
- Hello. - Hello.

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.589
- Oh, gosh. Hello. - Hello.

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:50.720
- Hello. - You lost so much weight.

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.960
(Humming)

00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:55.989
How's your back? Feeling better?

00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:57.429
- I can now... - Is it today?

00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:58.699
- Yes, it's today. - Is it today?

00:57:58.700 --> 00:57:59.729
I'll bite you for asking questions.

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:00.730
(Suspicious, nervous, sensitive, crying)

00:58:00.731 --> 00:58:03.199
Ju Hyun, you look determined.

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.699
- I know. - Isn't she so cool?

00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:07.639
- Gosh. - She has the composure.

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:08.709
Are you feeling okay?

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:11.379
Shuffle and turn.

00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.880
- That's crazy. - Did we bring a dancer?

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.050
From an expert's perspective,

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.750
you're going, "I'm nervous!"

00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:19.850
I couldn't sleep.

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:22.620
Players who are nervous tend to do that.

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:24.689
- I couldn't sleep at all. - Right.

00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:26.760
This is finally your first tournament.

00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:29.160
- Finally. - Your first tournament.

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.930
How are you feeling?

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.099
It couldn't be better!

00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:34.229
- Good? - I'm ready to enter the ring now.

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:35.369
- Really? - Yes.

00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:38.369
But we haven't passed the weigh-ins yet.

00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:39.439
- Of course. - I'm scared.

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.609
The two of you, Ju Hyun and In Ah had to lose weight.

00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:45.079
Right. It was so tough for them.

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:46.840
This morning,

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:49.250
I didn't even put on the moisturizer.

00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:52.549
I didn't even put on the body lotion after the shower.

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:54.789
- In case you get heavy? - In case I absorb the moisture...

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:57.319
- and become too heavy. - Gosh. I see.

00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.219
- I'm so thirsty right now. - And...

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:00.719
she got changed five times.

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:01.830
Why?

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:04.230
"Four hundred grams? No."

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:05.899
"Three hundred grams? No."

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:09.100
I adjusted the weight of my clothes to 200g.

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:12.069
They worked so hard to lose weight.

00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:13.199
Let's stand together.

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:14.439
Sure. Let's stay together.

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:15.840
- Let's stand like this. - Okay.

00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:19.609
First of all, to tell you the weight division,

00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:21.779
Uie, Sae Rok, and In Ah are...

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:23.449
entering the minus 54kg weight division.

00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:25.819
And Ju Hyun is in the minus 51kg weight division.

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:29.020
- A month ago, you all had a goal. - Yes.

00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:30.990
- Uie? - What was it?

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.589
- The muscles. - Increase 1kg of muscles.

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:34.860
And Sae Rok?

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:36.590
- Body fat. - Reduce the body fat.

00:59:36.790 --> 00:59:38.599
And In Ah and Ju Hyun.

00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.759
- Meet the weight division. - Meet the weight division.

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.629
We'll find out about that...

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:43.930
when we measure your weight later.

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:45.740
Sae Rok and Uie.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.469
- Uie. - Yes.

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:49.570
Did you manage to increase 1kg of muscle mass?

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:51.609
If you give me one more month...

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:53.310
What? A month?

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.209
While performing,

00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:57.109
I'd been on a diet a lot.

00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:59.380
But I wasn't sure about how to increase it.

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.289
You have to eat more protein than you think.

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:03.389
- I did until I got sick of it. - You have to eat more.

01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:04.889
- I know. - You have to eat more.

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:07.560
I had to do it while exercising.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.030
To be honest, it's still the same. It's 23kg.

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:13.499
- Really? As you can see, - I'm sorry.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.500
it's really hard...

01:00:14.501 --> 01:00:15.669
- to increase the muscles. - It's tough.

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:17.769
- I took it for granted. - It's really hard to do that.

01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:19.100
- I'm sorry. - What about your weight?

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.710
Is your weight still the same compared to a month ago?

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:24.009
I lost so much weight exercising.

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:26.610
So I lost weight down to 49kg and 50kg.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.479
I don't know.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.009
I'm trying to meet the weight.

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:31.849
Uie is actually...

01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:33.119
worried about being below the standard.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.689
This is my first time since my debut.

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:36.019
- Uie kept... - For some reason...

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.490
- losing weight. - You're getting skinnier.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:38.759
I'm just jealous.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.330
Sae Rok, you look anxious.

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:43.059
It says on your face that you're anxious.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.399
Are we checking Sae Rok's InBody?

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.730
Show me your InBody result. How did it go?

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.329
- Yes. - Okay.

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:50.430
Don't just say yes.

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:52.239
If you give us a month...

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.540
Please give us a month.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.410
We saw this coming...

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.639
and completed their missions.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.739
- What? - Our body fat is 16 percent.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.450
- Okay. - I lost five percent of body fat.

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:04.010
- My muscles increased by 1kg. - My muscle mass is 26kg.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.979
- Your muscles are 26kg? - Yes.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.749
- Amazing. - How did you increase it?

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:10.119
Because of the play,

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.659
- Yes? - I could only...

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.320
- exercise once a day. - Okay.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.759
I was losing confidence.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.299
"What if I fail to lose weight and can't even enter the ring?"

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.300
- I was too anxious to eat. - Right.

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:21.529
I'd never been so nervous...

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:22.629
- in my life before. - Me too.

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:25.769
- Boxing is a tough sport. - It's unbelievable.

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:28.570
People only see the games and training.

01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:29.910
But losing weight.

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.309
- Meeting the weight limit is... - Seriously.

01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:32.480
very tough.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.309
- You get to experience... - We went through...

01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:35.779
- how tough it is. - so much.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:36.949
We didn't have this for the triathlon.

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:38.219
- No. - No.

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.549
Still,

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.249
- I'm getting anxious. - You're anxious, right?

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:42.619
You have to take off your socks and everything.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.789
- I'm going to take off everything. - You have to take off everything.

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:45.060
Should I cut my hair?

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.859
Some boxers cut their hair, but...

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.759
- My hair grew. - You know what?

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.159
Based on what I see right now,

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.959
if you shave your head, you'll lose 500g.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.200
- Really? - I'm very accurate.

01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:56.569
- Five hundred grams... - Keep that in mind...

01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:58.269
- No. - if it's necessary.

01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:01.110
- No! - What's my occupation?

01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:02.710
- This is... - "No."

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:04.839
- your first weigh-in. - Yes.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.480
The moment you get on the scale and pass,

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:10.080
you become Boxer Park Ju Hyun.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.619
- Your first... - Oh, please.

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.179
Please help me this once.

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:15.519
It might be too much for you to even stay standing.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.589
- We can do it. - Let's do the weigh-in.

01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:17.989
- Let's go. Let's do the weigh-in. - We can do it. Let's go.

01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:19.690
- Girls, let's go. Let's do it. - Hurry up.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.560
Wait. Let me do this before I go in.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.289
I have to look strong.

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:25.700
- Let's go. - Yes.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.100
- We can do it. - Gosh.

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:29.530
Coach, this worries me more than the tournament.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.969
- Even more than my first play. - Oh, my gosh.

01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:32.339
This is more tense.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.569
(Will everyone be able to pass the weigh-in?)

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:35.939
- Hello. - Good luck.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.539
- Good luck. - Hello.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:38.609
Hello.

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:39.979
It says, "The boxer card registration."

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:40.980
That's cool.

01:02:40.981 --> 01:02:42.850
(Boxer Card Registration)

01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:46.479
(To register as a boxer: Fill out the basic information.)

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.719
(Basic medical check including the blood pressure)

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:55.090
(Measure the weight.)

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:57.590
(Starting with Captain Uie,)

01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:59.199
I'm so nervous.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.229
(they nervously fill out the boxer card.)

01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:03.470
Write your name.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.769
- Let's go. - Are you done?

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:07.239
- Yes. We got this. - See you.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.240
- You can do it. - We got this.

01:03:08.241 --> 01:03:09.839
Someone might come out crying.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.210
Scream if you don't make it.

01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:13.239
- Scream if you don't make it. - Then we'll dash out.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.280
Scream if you don't make it.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.979
(The mood is serious in the weigh-in room.)

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.720
- This way. - Okay.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.820
There aren't many people.

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:26.060
(First is the medical check.)

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.199
You can weigh in now.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.300
Thank you.

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:45.180
(She finally goes on the scale.)

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:50.280
(Uie was worried about going below the weight standard.)

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:58.719
(The weight range is 51.01kg to 54kg.)

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.089
It's 52.7kg.

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:02.860
(She passed as 52.7kg.)

01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:04.229
It's 52.7kg.

01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:07.630
(She safely passed the weigh-in.)

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.600
(Next is Sae Rok's turn.)

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:17.670
Wait. When I weighed myself...

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:21.649
(Her blood pressure check is taking way too long.)

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.209
If you don't make the weight, it'll be legendary.

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:24.820
(Her blood pressure check is taking way too long.)

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.980
How's your blood pressure normally?

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.219
It's a bit low.

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.720
- It's a bit low. - It is?

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.790
- Come back later. - Okay.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.160
- Come back later? - Yes.

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:36.489
- I didn't pass? - No.

01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:38.430
(I didn't pass?)

01:04:38.530 --> 01:04:39.999
- Come back when you're done. - Really?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.329
- Really? - It's too low.

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:42.670
(Sae Rok will measure it again because it's too low.)

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.899
I have low blood pressure too.

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.170
(I have low blood pressure too.)

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.909
(The blood pressure is the unexpected ambush.)

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:52.710
(It must be between 50 and 150 to be on the scale.)

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:55.349
- Are you nervous? - Yes.

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.409
It couldn't be more normal.

01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:57.550
Good.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.750
Now, I can move to the next step.

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:02.389
I'm taking my socks off.

01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:03.990
(I'm taking my socks off.)

01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.359
I'm taking the mic off.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.519
Me too.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.530
(Taking off everything that will add weight)

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:11.529
(Will her effort to lose weight be worthwhile?)

01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:12.959
Look how skinny she is.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.099
(Will her effort to lose weight be worthwhile?)

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.430
- I look forward to your service. - Go on.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.040
(Exhaling)

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:26.340
(She goes on the scale nervously.)

01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:33.619
(Dong Hyun and Ji Hoon wait for the Iron Girls.)

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.449
Why aren't they coming out? It's making me nervous.

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:37.390
(Why aren't they coming out? It's making me nervous.)

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:41.560
(Anxious, nervous)

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:49.499
(Ju Hyun has to be below 51kg to pass.)

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.570
It's 50.7kg.

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:55.639
(She passed as 50.7kg.)

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.840
Ju Hyun.

01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:59.840
Ju Hyun, please stay still.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.609
Uie.

01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:03.250
(Ju Hyun's body composition, height 166cm)

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.019
Don't cry. Come here.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.479
Put your clothes on. Come here.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.820
(Joy surges with relief)

01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:09.120
Thank you.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.089
Thank you.

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:12.260
(Thank you.)

01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:14.590
- Good job. - I can join the tournament.

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:16.860
You're really amazing.

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:18.930
Don't cry.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.459
You can weigh in now.

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:21.799
(In Ah weighs in next.)

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.170
(Extreme tension)

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Go up.

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:29.269
Please.

01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:32.240
(In Ah is nervous, but she goes up bravely.)

01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:36.810
(She sweated so much for today.)

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:46.089
(In Ah must be below 54kg to pass the weigh-in.)

01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:47.259
It's 53.8kg.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.530
(She passes as 53.8kg.)

01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:54.970
(By 200g, she passes the weigh-in for under 54kg.)

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.730
I did it. This is amazing.

01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.440
I know this is no big deal,

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:01.769
but I'm so proud of you.

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:03.610
- Oh, my gosh. - I almost cried.

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:04.939
(While the three who passed the weigh-in celebrate...)

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.140
I almost cried.

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:09.750
(Nervous)

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.019
- Is it too low? - I almost screamed.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.149
You made it.

01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:15.820
(She passed the medical checkup.)

01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:19.760
(Sae Rok is the last one to go on the scale.)

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:29.400
(She must be below 54kg to pass.)

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:30.930
It's 53.2kg.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.439
It's 53.2kg.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.970
(She passes as 53.2kg.)

01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:38.740
(Relieved)

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:41.809
I'm a boxer now.

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:43.850
(All Iron Girls passed the weigh-in.)

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:46.619
Should we tease Captain and Coach?

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.220
Me or you?

01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:53.590
(Their surprise strategy goes smoothly.)

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.629
- Thank you. - Thank you.

01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:56.790
They must be done.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.160
What happened?

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.130
- Are you done? - Are you done? How did it go?

01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:06.600
You didn't scream. All good?

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:09.139
No, it's okay.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:10.339
Only the two of us passed.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.780
- What? - We'll have to go for a run.

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:13.610
Hurry up.

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:14.980
Really?

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:16.409
We have to go for a run.

01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:17.509
- How did it go? - Who?

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.149
- How much time do we have left? - Who has to go for a run?

01:08:19.150 --> 01:08:20.180
Hurry up.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.589
- Sae Rok? - Really?

01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:23.220
Sae Rok, for 300g.

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:24.719
- For 300g. - For 300g?

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.119
(Pretending to be over 300g)

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.459
- My goodness. - But we were okay yesterday.

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.460
- You have to lose 300g? - No.

01:08:29.461 --> 01:08:30.489
No, we can run.

01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:32.259
- Hurry up. - Will running do?

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.730
- That won't be easy. - Hurry up and run.

01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:37.930
No, I'm not going to run.

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:39.840
Because she passed.

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.339
Seriously.

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.710
Because she passed.

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:44.269
Seriously.

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:46.180
(Did you fall for it?)

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:51.280
(Relieved)

01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:53.880
- You scared me to death. - It's...

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:57.489
You need to drink something warm.

01:08:57.490 --> 01:08:59.260
(Warming up with warm honey tea)

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.289
Whether it's high blood pressure or low blood pressure...

01:09:02.290 --> 01:09:03.659
I didn't know how good it was.

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.029
This is so good.

01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:06.030
It's 100 times sweeter.

01:09:06.031 --> 01:09:07.129
- Where's our meal? - This is so sweet.

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:08.130
We'll have to go eat.

01:09:08.131 --> 01:09:10.229
Now that you've passed the weigh-in,

01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:11.699
- let's go now. - Yes.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.740
Let's go.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.099
This is so good.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.210
Good job.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.970
You guys are so cool.

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:20.140
We've only...

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.310
completed one step.

01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:27.249
(Moving to the stadium)

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:29.289
You just finished the weigh-in.

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:30.649
Now,

01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:32.089
- what do you want to eat the most? - Fried chicken?

01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:34.189
We chatted about that a lot.

01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:35.889
The two of us talked about it a lot.

01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:36.929
- Right. - Right.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:38.800
"What's the first thing you're going to eat?"

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.299
- "What about you?" - "I'll have..."

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:41.359
- "jjajangmyeon." - She said jjajangmyeon.

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.629
- "I want jjajang ramyeon." - Yes.

01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:43.999
(Let's kill our senses for two days.)

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.369
Malatang or hot pot.

01:09:45.370 --> 01:09:46.769
I could even chew plastic.

01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:47.770
Right.

01:09:47.771 --> 01:09:49.569
Yes. They shouldn't put the mouthpiece.

01:09:49.570 --> 01:09:51.170
They'll even eat that.

01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:52.839
- Eat the mouthpiece? - "It's delicious."

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.380
- They'll think it's ham. - "It's yummy."

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:56.009
After the meal, the tournament will come to your mind,

01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:57.410
- and your heart will start racing. - Right.

01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.150
- All I can think of is the food. - Me too.

01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:04.189
(While Ju Hyun's chatting...)

01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:05.420
(Staring)

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:08.860
- It must be here. - We're here.

01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:10.390
- The stadium. - Are we there?

01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:12.059
(Iron Girls arrived...)

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.399
We have to look strong from here.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.699
(at the place of their first boxing tournament.)

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:15.999
It feels different...

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.400
now that this is our stadium.

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:22.940
(Reaching the first tournament stadium)

01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:28.140
(4 hours before the boxing tournament)

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:31.549
(Iron Girls arrived.)

01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:32.720
Where's my opponent?

01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:36.349
(Squealing)

01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:38.419
I passed the weigh-in.

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:39.559
(I passed the weigh-in.)

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.590
Hang on.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.330
Hang on. There are our enemies.

01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:43.960
- Wait for me. - I'll pretend to be cool.

01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:46.030
(Pretending to be cool as they enter)

01:10:46.031 --> 01:10:47.529
You look like real boxers.

01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:49.330
(Pretending to be cool as they enter)

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.470
- Is this the stadium? This is cool. - Is it here?

01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:53.270
What are they doing?

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.639
I think this is the ring.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.240
The ring must be here.

01:10:58.540 --> 01:10:59.540
(Gasping)

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:03.749
- Is this it? - No. I'm so nervous.

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:05.180
(How does their first stadium look?)

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:07.620
(2025 Seoul Boxing Association President's Cup)

01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:12.760
- Everyone will be focused on us. - Oh, no.

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:15.389
(Something steals Ju Hyun's attention.)

01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:16.659
Oh, the trophies.

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:17.829
(They're the trophies.)

01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:18.959
- Oh, the trophies. - Gosh.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.059
- I want them. - Look at this.

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.499
- Cool. - My goodness.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.829
Why are there trophies?

01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:23.830
For the overall champion.

01:11:23.831 --> 01:11:25.899
For the team with many players...

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:26.969
- and many wins. - For the team?

01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:29.410
(If many from a team win, they're given a trophy.)

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:30.609
Good. Let's go.

01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:32.209
Let's eat and get some rest.

01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:33.740
(Their first boxing tournament finally feels real.)

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.080
Let's go. This way.

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.580
(Exclaiming)

01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:42.250
Nice. This is nice.

01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:47.090
(This space was filmed with the cooperation of the school.)

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.360
- Oh, my gosh. - This is nice.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.589
(Why are the Iron Girls surprised?)

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:54.100
What is this?

01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:55.730
"Iron Girls."

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:58.130
- "Let's be champions." - "Let's be champions."

01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.670
After the weigh-in,

01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:02.610
it's important to consume healthy carbohydrates.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:05.310
And baekseolgi is the best.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:08.950
So for you to get a good result from your first tournament,

01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:10.909
I prepared it.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:12.379
(A good meal before the tournament)

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:13.550
Enjoy. Take one.

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:15.520
This is my favorite.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.289
(Sae Rok who must eat enjoys it.)

01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:20.689
This is the hardest part.

01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:21.889
(The Iron Girls enjoy the food.)

01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:23.359
- I'll stop eating and go. - What?

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.589
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:26.330
After the weigh-in,

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.670
the coaches have a coach meeting.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.969
(A coach meeting?)

01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:31.299
- That's so cool. - With who?

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.440
Everyone together.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.599
- All coaches coming today? - Yes.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.839
All coaches gather...

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.309
and do what they have to do.

01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:38.780
- See you. - I'll go talk to them.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.210
- Good luck. - See you.

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.949
(3 hours before the boxing tournament)

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:46.349
While the coach is attending the meeting,

01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:47.719
I researched...

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.790
the tournament bracket.

01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:51.449
The tournament bracket...

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:53.019
- Oh, I'm so nervous. - and the weight divisions.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.389
And how many joined.

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:58.829
First of all, about 200 boxers are participating.

01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:00.929
And 40 of them are female boxers.

01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:02.869
(40 female boxers out of 200 boxers in total)

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:05.000
- That's a lot. - Among them,

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:07.139
the elementary, middle school,

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.669
and high school and 20s are in the same division.

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:12.210
And the last division is over 30s.

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:16.049
The younger and lighter division will go first.

01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:21.150
The tournament is randomly selected.

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.619
As I said before,

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:24.919
this is a physical match,

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.119
and you have to hit each other.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.189
Regardless of how many there are,

01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:30.559
today, it's the quarterfinal, and tomorrow, it's the final.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:31.899
It's one game a day.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:33.029
It's two at a time no matter what.

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:35.129
Lose, and it's over. You don't have to come tomorrow.

01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:36.669
(Only the winners will keep competing.)

01:13:36.670 --> 01:13:37.929
(B: Winner)

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:39.669
(Semifinal tournament format)

01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:42.540
(Gold medal, silver medal, bronze medal)

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.509
- He's here. - Hey.

01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:45.980
(Coach Ji Hoon has returned.)

01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:47.510
Well...

01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:49.910
There's a little problem in today's tournament.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.820
- The coaches had a meeting. - Okay.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.779
We have a problem.

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.020
- Is there a southpaw? - What is it?

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.690
What's going on?

01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:00.389
One boxer failed to make weight.

01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:01.719
- Failed the weigh-in. - So...

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.430
- right now... - Really? Wait. Is this for real?

01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:06.060
- Uie's opponent was... - Yes?

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.530
disqualified for failing the weigh-in.

01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:09.670
She was disqualified for failing the weigh-in.

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:12.540
What?

01:14:14.370 --> 01:14:16.710
What? Then what happens to me? Can't I compete?

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:19.639
You've advanced to the finals by default.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:20.739
(Uie advances to the finals by default.)

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.050
Right. That means Uie is guaranteed at least a silver medal.

01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:26.220
This shows how important it is to make weight.

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.779
Self-management, including your weight, is...

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:28.919
Hold on.

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.350
Wait a minute. I feel a lot more pressure now.

01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:34.989
(Uie: Walkover, Boxer D: Missed the weigh-in)

01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:39.000
(Uie has secured the silver medal.)

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:40.630
Normally,

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.129
advancing to the finals through the preliminary rounds...

01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:44.730
- helps you warm up. - True.

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:47.269
Since you've already won a match,

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:48.810
- it could play in your favor. - Right.

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:51.140
On the other hand, in a way,

01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:53.880
- you're also lucky. - I see.

01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:56.850
It all comes down to personal luck.

01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:58.949
I have mixed feelings about it.

01:14:58.950 --> 01:15:01.279
I'm both happy and anxious.

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:03.890
- Of course. We understand. - Today, I'll watch the opponent...

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:06.020
I'll be facing tomorrow,

01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:08.090
cheer for the others,

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:10.960
and get ready for my match tomorrow.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.299
You have a slight smile on your face.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.230
I thought I'd lose in the preliminaries,

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:18.399
but now I'm suddenly in the finals.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.900
(Congratulations.)

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.980
(30 minutes before the boxing tournament begins)

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:31.010
(The boxers are warming up before the tournament begins.)

01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:34.450
(The strong determination to win)

01:15:35.150 --> 01:15:38.389
(The stands...)

01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:42.930
(are gradually filling up with spectators.)

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:47.660
(Family and friends of the boxers are here to cheer them on.)

01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:53.500
(In Ah?)

01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:56.039
(In Ah's parents, Ju Hyun's dad)

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.510
(The Iron Girls' family and friends are also here.)

01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:04.709
We will now begin the 2025 Seoul Boxing Association...

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:05.749
President's Cup.

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:08.920
(Elementary Division, Under 45kg, begins.)

01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:12.620
(What are the Iron Girls doing in the midst of this tension?)

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:36.750
(The 1st boxing tournament that will prove their past 3 months of effort)

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:41.950
(The last training)

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:44.550
This is the real thing.

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:46.619
Always treat the real match like practice,

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.019
and practice like the real match.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.330
Let's stay calm.

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:53.630
It's okay to lose. Let's make it a good fight...

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.630
and leave no regrets.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:16:59.839
Regardless of the result,

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.040
I want to see the fruits of my efforts.

01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:06.839
- This way. - Come on.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.880
Let's join hands.

01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:10.709
Recall your training. Listen to your coach.

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:12.250
- Good luck. I love you guys. - Let's all cheer.

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.579
It's time to enter the ring.

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:14.649
- KO! - KO!

01:17:14.650 --> 01:17:17.089
- Iron Girls! - Iron Girls!

01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:19.060
- Let's do this. - Good luck.

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.030
I'm cooling down. I'd better hurry.

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.360
In Ah should get ready.

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.129
Your bag. Give it to me.

01:17:30.130 --> 01:17:31.930
Boxers shouldn't carry their bags.

01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:34.940
Here, your bag. No, it's Ju Hyun's.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.409
Let's go.

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:38.540
(Staring)

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.079
(All their attention...)

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.449
(is on the venue.)

01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:46.420
There are three matches left, including this one.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.120
(The venue is already in a state of excitement.)

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:54.189
(The world of competition...)

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:58.930
(unfolds here.)

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.529
After the third match, it'll be In Ah's turn.

01:18:01.530 --> 01:18:02.670
The third after this one.

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:06.400
Stretch your joints and knees, In Ah.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.309
Sit down and stand up a few times. Loosen your shoulders.

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:10.969
(In Ah...)

01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:13.839
(calmly prepares for her match.)

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.310
There will be two more matches.

01:18:16.410 --> 01:18:17.950
- Gosh. - They're going all out.

01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:21.420
- They're good. - They're good.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.790
Really, those two are good.

01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:27.990
Both of them are good.

01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.789
(As each match ends,)

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:34.360
(In Ah's turn draws closer.)

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.269
- Let's go. - I'm off.

01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:37.730
We'll keep watching you, In Ah.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.339
- Good luck. - In Ah.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.440
If you win and make it to the next round.

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:43.670
- Good luck. - Good luck.

01:18:43.710 --> 01:18:46.379
(Cheered on by everyone,)

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:51.610
(In Ah heads to the ring.)

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.280
- Good luck. - Good luck.

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.519
- Go for it. - Good luck.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.020
- Good luck. - Good luck.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:01.960
I'm nervous all of a sudden.

01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:03.790
Let's go!

01:19:04.190 --> 01:19:05.599
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.659
- Good luck. - He said, "Good luck."

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:08.999
- Thank you. - It's okay.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.900
- He must've just arrived. - Don't be nervous.

01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:13.700
(10 minutes before In Ah fights)

01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:16.740
(In Ah has entered the venue.)

01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:21.880
(She heads straight to the glove room.)

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.679
- Good luck. - Good luck.

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.520
- Good luck. - Good luck, Seol In Ah.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.950
- Good luck, Seol In Ah. - Good luck, Seol In Ah.

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.650
(Let's do this.)

01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:33.760
(She arrives at the glove room.)

01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:36.290
- Any jewelry on you? - No.

01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:37.959
We're in your care.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.559
(Making eye contact with today's opponent)

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.960
The opponent greeted her.

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.030
- Her opponent is... - She's very small.

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:46.899
True, but she looks strong.

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:48.000
Let's watch the match.

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:50.270
(Kim Min Jung, 20s, under 54kg)

01:19:50.710 --> 01:19:51.909
(Boxing experience: 6 months)

01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:53.880
(Special martial arts experience: 6 years)

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:58.150
(In Ah quickly puts on her gear.)

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:01.149
- Coach. - You need this.

01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:03.250
- Coach. I'm nervous. - Don't worry.

01:20:03.490 --> 01:20:04.519
It's okay. It's the same.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:07.159
Remember how it felt like nothing after our sparring session?

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.529
It was like that every time we reviewed the matches.

01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:10.530
Nothing is different.

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:12.330
Let's go.

01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:15.730
- Good luck. - In Ah is going now.

01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:17.470
Oh, dear.

01:20:18.670 --> 01:20:20.540
In Ah must be really nervous.

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:24.840
(Good luck, In Ah.)

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:28.710
(After seeing the others, she smiles brightly.)

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:34.550
(The match from the front heat begins before In Ah's match.)

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.620
(Her first match is just around the corner.)

01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:41.790
Fighting first is making me really nervous.

01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:44.460
Don't be nervous. That's all that matters.

01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:46.029
How can I not get nervous?

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:47.460
- It's my first ever... - Then just a little.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.299
- Be nervous just a little. - Just a bit.

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:51.829
- I'll be just a little nervous... - Okay.

01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:53.200
- as small as this fist. - Okay.

01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:55.539
(The opponent seems nervous too.)

01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:57.409
Her opponent must also be nervous.

01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:59.610
(She quietly loosens up her body.)

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:03.149
In Ah's opponent seemed quite short.

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:05.380
- There's a big height difference. - She's short but sturdy.

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.220
The opponent might have a strong punch.

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:10.450
(In Ah is about to fight a mysterious opponent.)

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.319
(The front heat's match has ended.)

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.460
- Kim Yeo Jin is the winner. - Kim Yeo Jin.

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.590
Let's go.

01:21:19.330 --> 01:21:21.430
That's it. Good. Warm your body up.

01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:25.840
Match 32 of the under-54kg division.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.439
In the Red Corner,

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.610
- Iron Girls' Seol In Ah. - Let's go.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.309
- Good luck. - In the Blue Corner...

01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:35.210
(Red Corner: Seol In Ah)

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.680
- Good luck, Seol In Ah. - Good luck, Seol In Ah.

01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:43.249
(Entering the ring to the cheers of many spectators)

01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:44.250
Greet him.

01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:46.419
(The referee's gear inspection)

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:47.420
Your hands.

01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:48.720
Mouthguard.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.890
- Good. - Good luck.

01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:53.900
Stay calm.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.970
(The boxers meet at the center.)

01:21:57.630 --> 01:21:59.739
Watch out for the back of your head and open blows.

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.339
- Don't punch below the belt. - Okay.

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:02.410
Touch gloves.

01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:04.369
- To your corners. - Good luck, Seol In Ah.

01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:06.580
- Good luck. - Good luck.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.050
Feint with a jab and move in with a one-two combination.

01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:10.409
Throw a feint, okay?

01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:11.580
(Sharing the strategy one last time)

01:22:11.710 --> 01:22:12.780
- Throw a feint, okay? - Good luck.

01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:18.350
(In Ah is about to compete in her first tournament.)

01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:20.320
Do everything you want, In Ah.

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.089
(Seol In Ah versus Kim Min Jung)

01:22:22.090 --> 01:22:24.230
(Round 1 begins.)

01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:27.359
Box.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.670
(Round 1, Under 54kg: Seol In Ah versus Kim Min Jung)

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.670
Turn.

01:22:44.650 --> 01:22:47.250
(In Ah keeps her distance and eyes her opponent.)

01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:49.889
Her opponent ducks in and attacks using both hooks.

01:22:49.890 --> 01:22:52.020
Dodge both hooks, then counter with a one-two.

01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:56.060
That's it.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.530
- Guard up. - Yes, again.

01:22:58.730 --> 01:23:00.860
- Good. Again. - Small punches.

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:03.570
Yes.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.840
Good. That's it.

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.880
(One, two)

01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:14.610
Nice.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.050
(One, two)

01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:20.279
(In Ah's clean punches draw a roar of applause.)

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.319

That's it. It's okay.

01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:29.360
Good. Nice one.

01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:30.930
Yes.

01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:34.959
Move in. Attack.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.169
Close in. Come on.

01:23:37.170 --> 01:23:39.100
(The opponent slips in and lands a hook.)

01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:41.899
Stop.

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:44.010
(Stop)

01:23:44.210 --> 01:23:45.810
(A warning given to In Ah.)

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.010
Don't keep your arm straight.

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.379
(Passive: Excessively keeping distance...)

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:54.480
(or only extending your arms, resulting in a warning)

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.789
Box.

01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:57.349
(The match resumes after a warning is given.)

01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:58.350
Guard up. Eyes ahead.

01:23:58.351 --> 01:23:59.690
(Another wide hook lands)

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:02.260
(Keeping a distance for a short while)

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.959
(A slugfest begins.)

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:05.960
Again.

01:24:05.961 --> 01:24:07.100
In Ah is a little annoyed.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.830
(A flurry of one-two combinations)

01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:12.969
That's it.

01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:14.270
Keep going.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.940
The opponent took some damage.

01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:18.710
Don't stop, In Ah.

01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:21.780
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:24.510
Move in, In Ah!

01:24:25.050 --> 01:24:26.750
Step back and reset your stance.

01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:28.780
Yes, attack.

01:24:29.490 --> 01:24:30.850
- In Ah has to get annoyed. - That's it.

01:24:31.050 --> 01:24:32.119
- In Ah is annoyed. - Nice.

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.220
Good.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:36.890
(Round 1 ends with In Ah's clean shot.)

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.400
Okay. Nice.

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:41.800
In Ah needs to get furious.

01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:46.040
(The venue is buzzing with excitement.)

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.410
(40-second rest period)

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.909
She's really strong.

01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:51.970
She's not strong at all.

01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:53.940
The opponent can only read one of your moves.

01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:55.539
Keep feinting and attacking.

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:56.650
That's more than enough.

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:57.809
As soon as the opponent...

01:24:57.810 --> 01:24:59.380
reacts to your feint, strike back.

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:00.550
Counter that attack.

01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:02.850
- As soon as the opponent reacts. - Good luck.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:04.949
(The Blue Corner also goes over the strategy.)

01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:06.389
You're doing great.

01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:07.419
Breathe.

01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:08.990
Be more aggressive, okay?

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.629
Duck,

01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:12.530
come up straight, and punch. Got it?

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.759
Follow it up with a double hook, okay?

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.799
Breathe.

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:18.200

01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:21.340

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.649
Box.

01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:30.980
(Round 2 begins.)

01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:32.379
(Dodging the hook)

01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:33.520
That's it.

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:34.620
Block.

01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:37.120
(She dodges again and then throws a one-two.)

01:25:37.890 --> 01:25:38.949
Yes, go for it.

01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:40.390
(Hooks keep raining in aggressively.)

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.520
Attack.

01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:44.830
(In Ah counters with an endless one-two combination.)

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.700
You're fighting well, In Ah. You're so cool.

01:25:46.730 --> 01:25:47.760
- Nice. - Jab.

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:50.329
- That's it. - Jab.

01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:51.330
(Hooks keep coming in relentlessly)

01:25:51.331 --> 01:25:52.370
Guard up.

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:53.670
Keep going.

01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:55.840
Don't stop.

01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:57.840
Make the first move, In Ah.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.510
Move in.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.840
Again.

01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:04.149
Try attacking twice.

01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:05.409
(She needs to attack more aggressively.)

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:06.850
That was so close.

01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:12.890
(The opponent keeps landing double hooks.)

01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:14.320
You've got to move in even if you're tired, In Ah.

01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:15.930
In Ah, you can do it.

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:18.530
(She dodged the hook and countered with a straight.)

01:26:18.930 --> 01:26:20.530
(A double strike)

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:21.660
- Yes. - Yes.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.300
Well done.

01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:26.040
(Her powerful punch landed perfectly.)

01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:28.500
(Stop)

01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:30.909
K.O.

01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:32.680
(Standing 8 count for the Blue Corner)

01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:41.620
You're so cool, Seol In Ah.

01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:44.189
(Standing 8 count: If a boxer is judged...)

01:26:44.190 --> 01:26:46.359
(unable to continue safely, the referee counts...)

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.559
(from 1 to 8 to determine whether the match can go on.)

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.960
(Failure to recover within the count may result in a K.O.)

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:53.199
(After checking the boxer's condition,)

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.999
(the match resumes.)

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.070
Box.

01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:58.599
A long reach.

01:26:58.600 --> 01:26:59.669
Counter right away.

01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:01.139
That's it. Just like that.

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:04.940
(Another flurry of punches)

01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:07.639
(Two, one, two)

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.210
Yes, that's what a K.O. is.

01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:14.820
(Even a powerful straight punch)

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.320
Nice. One more time.

01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:18.919
Again.

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.090
(The opponent's double hook)

01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:23.259
Duck.

01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:24.330
Attack.

01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:26.930
Duck.

01:27:26.931 --> 01:27:29.199
(An intense showdown until the end)

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.430
Hurry, one more time.

01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:32.529
Stop.

01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:34.140
(Round 2 ends.)

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:38.810
(In Ah has completed all her rounds safely.)

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.539
Well done.

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:49.250
(All that's left is the judges' decision.)

01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:51.919
Why is my heart pounding like crazy?

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.420
The opponent's punches were pretty wide,

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:56.860
so they did some damage to In Ah.

01:27:56.890 --> 01:27:58.629
But In Ah landed way more clean shots.

01:27:58.630 --> 01:27:59.730
- You're right. - Yes.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.929
The results are being tallied.

01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:05.029
What will the final decision be?

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:06.800
(Head referee)

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:10.569
(In Ah returns to the center of the ring for the decision.)

01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:12.640
Please, In Ah.

01:28:12.810 --> 01:28:14.279
Please, In Ah.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:16.310
- Red. - Red.

01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:18.380
Red. Please.

01:28:19.050 --> 01:28:20.079
Red.

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:21.120
(A tense moment...)

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.350
(as she waits for the decision after her very first fight)

01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:27.860
- Kim Min Jung! - Kim Min Jung!

01:28:28.090 --> 01:28:29.829
(A fierce cheering battle)

01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:31.490
They're from the opponent's gym.

01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:33.499
- Seol In Ah! - Seol In Ah!

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.100
(We can't lose the cheering battle.)

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:39.100
(In Ah's parents)

01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:43.540
(With wide hooks, the Blue Corner attacked fiercely.)

01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:48.340
(In Ah's precise strikes led to a standing 8 count.)

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:53.150
(Who is the winner?)

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:57.090
(The head referee has tallied all the scores.)

01:28:57.450 --> 01:29:00.320
(What's the outcome of the Iron Girls' first match?)

01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:09.800
(Seol In Ah wins.)

01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:13.639

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.740
Thank you.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.570
Thank you.

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.470
Thank you. Great work.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:23.110
(In Ah earned her first precious victory.)

01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:24.710
(Screaming)

01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:29.119
(The members are in festive mode.)

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.950
She did an amazing job.

01:29:31.090 --> 01:29:32.690
She was incredible.

01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:36.829
(Even In Ah's parents are touched.)

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:38.390
You're the best.

01:29:38.490 --> 01:29:40.800
- You're the best. Let's go! - Here.

01:29:42.330 --> 01:29:43.470
I won.

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:44.729
- Great job. - Seriously.

01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:46.169
- I can't believe it. - Good job.

01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:47.339
- Well done. - For real?

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.499
You won.

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:49.540
(Enjoying the victory outside the ring)

01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:53.440
(An emotional hug with Coach Kim)

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.609
(Amazed)

01:29:56.610 --> 01:29:57.880
This feels like a dream.

01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:02.219
(People congratulate and cheer In Ah.)

01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:03.320
Great work.

01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:05.090
- Thank you. - In Ah.

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:06.820
You were the best.

01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:10.829
(And those waiting for In Ah)

01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:13.200
In Ah, you did an incredible job.

01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:14.630
Coach.

01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:17.530
- You did really well, In Ah. - For real.

01:30:17.630 --> 01:30:21.370
There were 2 to 3 close calls halfway through the match.

01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:22.739
If you had kept getting cornered,

01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:24.239
you would have left a bad impression on the referee.

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.139
But you countered with a flurry of punches.

01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:28.209
- You made a flurry right away. - I don't remember.

01:30:28.210 --> 01:30:29.649
- You were great, In Ah. - A fighter.

01:30:29.650 --> 01:30:30.949
- In Ah. - In Ah.

01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:32.079
You're a fighter.

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:33.820
- A fighter, In Ah. - I should leave.

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.280
The match was really fun.

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.689
- People went wild, you know? Yes. - Really?

01:30:38.690 --> 01:30:39.989
What will you do about this thrill...

01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:41.089
- from now on? - This is so much fun.

01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:43.429
What are you going to do? Where will you find it now?

01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:44.459
- It's so fun. Oh, my gosh. - You can only experience it...

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:46.460
- in a tournament. - It was so much fun.

01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.759
My blood is boiling. This is crazy.

01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:50.299
I'm worried about what you'll do from now on.

01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:51.300
While watching your match,

01:30:51.301 --> 01:30:52.569
I thought, "She should continue boxing."

01:30:52.570 --> 01:30:53.640
(Simba Seol has a fighter's blood.)

01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:56.770
(Meanwhile,)

01:30:57.210 --> 01:31:00.780
(the tournament continues.)

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:03.080
Good luck. What matters is the momentum, Ju Hyun.

01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:06.979
- I'm off. - Okay. Show them what you've got.

01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:08.050
- Good luck. - Do as much as you practiced.

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.289
- Good luck. - Thank you.

01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:12.250
- Good luck. - Thank you.

01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:14.389
- Good luck, Park Ju Hyun. - Good luck.

01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:16.120
- Good luck. - Thank you.

01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:19.900
(Ju Hyun enters the venue.)

01:31:19.930 --> 01:31:21.299
How do you feel right now?

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.100
- I'm okay. Yes. - Really?

01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:26.299
(After the attire check in the glove room)

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:27.740
- Any jewelry on you? - No.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:35.580
(Putting on the gear right away)

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:37.150
How are you? All good?

01:31:38.250 --> 01:31:39.950
- If I'm losing, I'll keep going. - That's Ju Hyun.

01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:42.319
- It's not, is it? - I'm not nervous right now.

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.520
(Ju Hyun waits calmly for her match.)

01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:44.950
Where's our baby?

01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:47.220
(Looking around)

01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:48.919
Park Ju Hyun. Good luck, Gwang Bok.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.030
I love you.

01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:52.190
Trust your instinct.

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:55.300
(Feeling the support)

01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:57.799
There's one match before yours.

01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:58.929
It's your turn right after it.

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:00.270
(Ju Hyun's match is about to start.)

01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:02.640
My opponent looks small.

01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:04.539
The one over there.

01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:05.870
(The one over there.)

01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:07.040
I wonder...

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.310
if she's good.

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.810
(Yang Seo Jeong, 30s, under 51kg)

01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:17.090
(Boxing experience: 1 years and 6 months)

01:32:17.850 --> 01:32:19.220
She looks like she'll do well.

01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:21.159
She looks really strong.

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:22.619
- No. - No.

01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:23.760
Not at all.

01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:25.829
Do it as you did before.

01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:26.959
Remember what we practiced earlier?

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.230
That alone is more than enough.

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:33.800
(Ju Hyun, who is always calm, seems nervous today.)

01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:38.110
(However, to advance to the finals, she must beat the opponent.)

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:42.040
(The front heat's match has ended.)

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:45.650
(It's time for Ju Hyun to enter the ring.)

01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:48.050
Let's go.

01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:51.320

(One last mental check)

01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:27.360
- Good luck. - Good luck.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.360
No open blows.

(Touch gloves)

01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:32.489
To your corners.

(Back to their corners)

01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:37.399

(Feeling out in the early round)

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.179
Here they go. But she should feel her out first.

01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:50.049

She cornered the opponent.

01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:07.080
- She cornered the opponent. - Immediately.

01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:08.980
Well done.

01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:12.089
- It's not bad. - Right?

01:36:12.090 --> 01:36:13.290
- I told you. - I can do it.

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.419
She's out of energy.

01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:16.560
- You noticed, right? - Yes.

01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:18.160
You could've knocked her out.

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.429
Try and attack her even more, okay?

01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:22.829
You're calm and doing well. That's how you should fight, okay?

01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:24.670
- Use your lead hand, got it? - Good luck.

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:27.700
(The Red Corner discusses their strategy.)

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.640
With how things are right now...

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:31.339
(Whispering)

01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:33.480
(Their strategy meeting is behind closed doors.)

01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.410
- Stronger, okay? - Okay.

01:36:36.010 --> 01:36:37.050
You can do it.

01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:38.750
You're doing well. Drink some water.

01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:42.720
Use your lead hand, got it?

01:36:42.850 --> 01:36:44.490
Use your lead hand, but watch her rear hand.

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:47.759
- Good luck. - Good luck.

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:49.590
- Good luck. - Good luck.

01:36:50.130 --> 01:36:51.160
- Box. - Good luck.

01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:54.559
(Round 2 begins.)

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.130
(Round 2, Under 51kg: Yang Seo Jeong versus Park Ju Hyun)

01:36:58.100 --> 01:36:59.370
Attack her.

01:36:59.770 --> 01:37:01.639
Fight a bit more aggressively.

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:02.800
Try to take the lead.

01:37:05.370 --> 01:37:06.640
- Good luck. - Move in. That's it.

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:08.310
All the way.

01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:10.150
Pivot out. Punch her.

01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:12.050
That's it. Yes.

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:14.020
Yes! Keep going.

01:37:14.250 --> 01:37:17.620
(Sprinting to the other side of the ring)

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:21.020
(Valid strike)

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.520
Great.

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:24.390
She's tough.

01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:26.859
(The venue is going wild...)

01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:28.500
(at her relentless attack.)

01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:30.670
Well done. She hit the opponent countless times.

01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:32.400
Pivot. That's it.

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:33.970
Pivot, Ju Hyun. Nice.

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:38.469
(The slugfest continues.)

01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:40.840
- Good luck. - Yes. Well done.

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:43.010
Nice.

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.679
(The opponent attacks Ju Hyun.)

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.510
- Good luck. - You can do it.

01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:49.279
(A jab,)

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.850
(followed by a right hook)

01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:54.260
(Finishing off with a left hook)

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:57.659
(Throwing a series of jabs)

01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:58.730
You can do it, Ju Hyun.

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:02.099
Throw consecutive punches. Good. You're doing well.

01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:03.769
(Both boxers keep their distance, looking for an opening.)

01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:05.970
- Good. - You can do it.

01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:08.669
That's it. Right away. Yes.

01:38:08.670 --> 01:38:10.310
Ju Hyun's grit is insane.

01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:12.139
Pivot.

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:14.180
- Attack her. - That's it. Pivot.

01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:15.839
Good luck.

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.780
(Both boxers hold back, wary of each other's powerful punches.)

01:38:19.110 --> 01:38:20.250
Another attack,

01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.980
- She's waiting for a straight. - and she'll win.

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:25.049
Punch. That's it. Keep going.

01:38:25.050 --> 01:38:27.220
Yes. That's what I'm talking about. One more time.

01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:28.720
You can do it.

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.160
- Try again. - Good luck.

01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:33.360
Block her. That's it.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.700
(Her straight lands perfectly.)

01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.309
- Nice. Good job. - Yes.

01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:46.370
(After cornering her opponent, Ju Hyun unleashes a flurry.)

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:48.309
That's it. Yes.

01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:49.939
The opponent is tired.

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:51.609
- Ten seconds. - Well done.

01:38:51.610 --> 01:38:53.179
- Ten seconds, Park Ju Hyun. - Yes.

01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:54.180
Keep going.

01:38:54.250 --> 01:38:56.480
(Both boxers keep fighting until the end.)

01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:00.360
(They trade valid strikes in a clinch until the last moment.)

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:01.960
Stop.

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:05.859
(Round 2 ends.)

01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:07.360
Great work.

01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:08.900
Well done.

01:39:10.530 --> 01:39:12.400
Good job.

01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:14.170
You're good.

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.439
(Feeling proud)

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.669
Great job.

01:39:18.670 --> 01:39:21.240
- She won. - Yes, she won.

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:24.079
(Ju Hyun went all out and delivered a great match.)

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.180
Well done. I told you.

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:34.460
(Returning to the center of the ring for the decision)

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:37.489
I think Ju Hyun won the match.

01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:38.859
- Me too. - Please.

01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:39.989
I think she won.

01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:41.330
The opponent took more hits.

01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:43.930
Anyone can see the opponent almost got knocked out.

01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:45.299
- She won. - She won for sure.

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.039
How Ju Hyun cornered her from the Blue Corner...

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.570
- to the Red Corner was impressive. - I agree.

01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:52.410
(From one side of the ring to the other)

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:56.980
(She cornered her opponent and attacked like a bulldozer.)

01:39:57.550 --> 01:40:02.780
(Did Ju Hyun win after firing up the crowd?)

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:05.490
The opponent might earn big points for her proactiveness.

01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:08.790
Although she didn't land many punches,

01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:10.629
the opponent cornered Ju Hyun.

01:40:10.630 --> 01:40:12.360
(The opponent didn't stop attacking.)

01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:14.029
That must have earned her major points.

01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:15.060
(Did the opponent win?)

01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:17.400
Please give points to Ju Hyun.

01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:18.870
Please.

01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:22.569
(Everyone is eagerly waiting.)

01:40:22.570 --> 01:40:23.740
Please.

01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:25.609
Please, Ju Hyun.

01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:30.580
(What's the outcome of this match?)

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:42.590
(Park Ju Hyun wins.)

01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:50.570
I knew it. She won.

01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:53.440
Exactly. I approve. She won.

01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:55.639
(Gwang Bok's dad is happy that his daughter won.)

01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:57.440
(My daughter is the best.)

01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:59.410
(Greatly touched)

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:01.480
(Park Ju Hyun advances to the finals.)

01:41:01.481 --> 01:41:03.980
Well done.

01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.150
I'm tired.

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.949
You did perfectly.

01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:13.120
You did it.

01:41:13.890 --> 01:41:15.259
(The crowd applauds Ju Hyun.)

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:17.959
I was lucky.

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.160
(The crowd applauds Ju Hyun.)

01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:20.700
Thank you.

01:41:21.130 --> 01:41:23.469
I won because you guys cheered me on.

01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:24.800
(The students next to them)

01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:27.969
(Reuniting with her beloved members)

01:41:27.970 --> 01:41:29.970
- Ju Hyun. - You did really well.

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.969
- Good job. - Ju Hyun.

01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:33.169
- Well done. - Good job.

01:41:33.170 --> 01:41:35.139
- It was exhausting. - Great job.

01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.780
The opponent had good stamina.

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.649
Both of you are amazing.

01:41:39.650 --> 01:41:42.320
- You two are fighters. - It was so much fun.

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:44.389
To think three months could change you so much,

01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:45.690
when you used to dodge punches.

01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:48.290
- Wasn't it fun? - I was lucky.

01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:51.790
(The tournament continues.)

01:41:52.590 --> 01:41:53.730
That's it.

01:41:54.130 --> 01:41:56.930
(Sae Rok's turn is approaching.)

01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:58.870
Okay. Let's go, Sae Rok.

01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:02.140
Sae Rok, if the opponent throws 2 punches, counter with 4.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:04.110
Throw plenty of straight punches.

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:05.570
My Rocky Keum.

01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:08.640
The symbol of luck.

01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:10.749
You don't have to aim at the opponent's face.

01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:11.979
- Just extend your punch, - Okay.

01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:13.580
- and it'll land here. - Got it.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.750
- You're the symbol of luck. - Trust yourself.

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:16.889
- I'm off. - Stretch out,

01:42:16.890 --> 01:42:17.890
and you'll punch the opponent.

01:42:17.891 --> 01:42:18.950
You'll do well.

01:42:19.190 --> 01:42:20.559
Good luck, Keum Sae Rok.

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.990
Good luck.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.390
(Being cheered on by the crowd...)

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.160
(makes the match feel more real.)

01:42:28.330 --> 01:42:29.930
- I feel weak. - You do?

01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:34.400
It's just nerves. You'll be fine once you step into the ring.

01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:35.639
There's no need to be nervous.

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:38.340
(The coaches help Sae Rok relax.)

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:41.010
(But her face stiffens from nervousness.)

01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:42.380
Show him your hands.

01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:44.910
No jewelry on you, right?

01:42:45.150 --> 01:42:46.349
You've got your pads on, right?

01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:47.550
- I'm in your care. - Same here.

01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:52.090
- I'm in your care. - Hey. Same here.

01:42:52.190 --> 01:42:53.590
We're in your care.

01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:57.259
Sae Rok's opponent.

01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:58.260
(Kim Bo Min, 30s, under 54kg)

01:42:58.261 --> 01:42:59.560
- She's someone new. - Yes.

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:03.160
(Boxing experience: 1 year)

01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:05.370
I know it won't happen,

01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:08.269
- but I can't help but feel anxious. - She can do it.

01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:10.310
I have faith in Sae Rok. She will win.

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.009
(How is Sae Rok doing?)

01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:13.139
She can do it.

01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:14.280
I have faith in her too.

01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:18.150
It's mine. I can do it.

01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:20.920
Let's have fun.

01:43:21.250 --> 01:43:23.420
- I can do it. - You'll do well.

01:43:23.650 --> 01:43:24.989
I'm an Iron Girl.

01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:26.049
Of course.

01:43:26.050 --> 01:43:27.820
- It's up to my spirit. - Stick to your routine.

01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:31.890
(Meanwhile, the front heat's match has ended.)

01:43:32.630 --> 01:43:33.899
(It's time to show what she has practiced.)

01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:35.199
That should be enough.

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:36.259
(It's time to show what she has practiced.)

01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:37.829
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:40.400
- Keum Sae Rok, let's go! - Keum Sae Rok, let's go!

(If Sae Rok wins, everyone will enter the finals.)

01:43:56.650 --> 01:43:59.749
In the Blue Corner, Star Boxing's Kim Bo Min.

01:43:59.750 --> 01:44:01.860
(However, the opponent has a lot of boxing experience.)

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.989
(Iron Girls' last match in the preliminaries)

01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:06.859
As soon as you hear the bell, put your guard up.

01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:08.400
Do as you've always done, okay?

01:44:08.430 --> 01:44:10.800
- You're better than you think. - Okay.

01:44:11.170 --> 01:44:12.929
- Let's do this. - Yes. It's okay.

01:44:12.930 --> 01:44:13.939
Do as you've always done.

01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:15.669

01:44:18.210 --> 01:44:20.409
(The boxers come to the center.)

01:44:20.410 --> 01:44:21.579
Watch your head.

01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:22.679
Watch out for the open blows.

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:23.749
Don't punch below the belt, okay?

01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:25.009
- Don't hit the back of the head. - Okay.

01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:26.010
Touch gloves.

01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:31.019
(Keum Sae Rok versus Kim Bo Min)

01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:33.789
(Round 1 begins.)

01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:34.819
Box.

01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:41.560
(Her opponent attacks first.)

01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:44.400
(Sae Rok turns right away.)

01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:46.029
Let's go. There you go.

01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:47.499
(A slugfest begins.)

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.970
Keep going.

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.039
(Sae Rok's straight punch)

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:54.880
There you go. Keep going.

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:56.639
You can do it!

01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.080
(The opponent's body shot and hook)

01:44:58.350 --> 01:45:00.580
- There you go. - That's good.

01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:01.819
Turn.

01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:03.120
(Sae Rok's one-two punches follow.)

01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:05.220

(Sae Rok's one-two punches versus the opponent's body attacks)

01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:22.669
- Let's go! - Let's go!

01:45:22.670 --> 01:45:23.670
Keum Sae Rok!

01:45:23.671 --> 01:45:24.869
(Again, it's Sae Rok's one-two versus the opponent's body shot)

01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:26.840
There you go. That's good.

01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:31.849

Throw a punch.

01:45:45.630 --> 01:45:46.830
Throw a punch.

01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:48.500
Throw a punch.

01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:51.799
- You can go in there. - Throw a punch.

01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:52.870
The opponent can't get closer.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.099
- Punch. - There you go.

01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:55.240
Until the end.

01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:56.670
- Turn. - Until the end.

01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:58.370
- Throw a punch. - Pivot.

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:00.909
There you go. Pivot.

01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:02.180
(Sae Rok pivots as she attacks.)

01:46:08.150 --> 01:46:09.880
There you go.

01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:12.889
(After a jab)

01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:13.959
That's how you do it.

01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.220
- There you go. - Keep going.

01:46:15.790 --> 01:46:17.189
Keep punching.

01:46:17.190 --> 01:46:18.230
One more punch.

01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:19.459
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:21.129
- Keep punching. - Ten seconds!

01:46:21.130 --> 01:46:23.730
(They attack at the same time.)

01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:29.970
- Time! - There you go.

01:46:30.370 --> 01:46:33.170
(Round 1 ends.)

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:36.180
Sit.

01:46:36.181 --> 01:46:37.350
In Round One,

01:46:38.110 --> 01:46:39.980
I think she won with a score of 6 to 4.

01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:42.349
- Really? Thank goodness. - Yes.

01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:44.650
- Sae Rok has more valid strikes. - That's right.

01:46:45.650 --> 01:46:48.590
Your opponent only has one attacking pattern.

01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:50.059
If you throw a two, it'll land.

01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:51.230
Why aren't you doing it?

01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:53.329
Throw a two and a hook, okay?

01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:55.659
Also, don't get cornered or try to attack at the same time.

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:58.430
Then you'll get sucked into her pace. Stick to your pace.

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:00.799
You can corner her more.

01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.500
- Corner her if you want to win. - Okay.

01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.339
Corner her if you want to win.

01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:07.639
(The opponent's strategy is to press her more.)

01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:08.710
Okay?

01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:12.049
(It's the last round for advancing to the finals.)

01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:13.180
Keum Sae Rok, good luck.

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:14.919
(She needs to pour her everything into the match.)

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:17.719
- Keum Sae Rok, good luck! - You can do it.

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.749
Round Two.

01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:19.789
(Round 2 begins.)

01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:20.790
Box.

01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:24.389
(The last round that'll determine the result)

01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:27.499
(Round 2, Under 54kg: Keum Sae Rok versus Kim Bo Min)

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:28.600
There you go.

01:47:28.630 --> 01:47:30.260
Punch. There you go. Yes.

01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:31.700
Good.

01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:33.769
(Sae Rok's valid strikes: 1)

01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:36.769
(Sae Rok's valid strikes: 2)

01:47:36.770 --> 01:47:38.469
(Sae Rok's valid strikes: 3, The opponent's valid strikes: 1)

01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:40.269
(Sae Rok's valid strikes: 4, The opponent's valid strikes: 1)

01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:42.710
(Sae Rok's valid strikes: 4, The opponent's valid strikes: 2)

01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:44.380
Keep going.

01:47:45.550 --> 01:47:47.279
(The opponent focuses on the body.)

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.950
Keep going.

01:47:49.150 --> 01:47:50.449
(However, Sae Rok defends with her long reach.)

01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:52.220
- Keep going. - Try again.

01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:53.520
Keep going.

01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:55.159
There you go. One more. Do it now.

01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:56.890
(She does the one-two.)

01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:00.229
(Sae Rok does the one-two without stopping.)

01:48:00.230 --> 01:48:01.600
There you go. That's good.

01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:08.970
Do it again.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
There you go.

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:14.479
(The jab landed well.)

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:16.480
(Staggering)

01:48:19.450 --> 01:48:22.250
(It's Sae Rok's chance to finish off the opponent.)

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.549
There you go. Again.

01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:26.920
- What are you doing? - Why did you stop?

01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:28.189
Why did you wait?

01:48:28.190 --> 01:48:29.819
Sae Rok, why did you wait?

01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:31.729
- Keep going! - Sae Rok, why did you wait?

01:48:31.730 --> 01:48:34.600
(Meanwhile, the opponent recovers.)

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.899
(She pushes Sae Rok to a corner.)

01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:39.030
Yes. That's it.

01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:41.169
Pivot. There you go.

01:48:41.170 --> 01:48:42.339
She dodged well.

01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:43.569
That's good. She dodged all the attacks.

01:48:43.570 --> 01:48:44.770
She dodged all the attacks. She didn't get hit.

01:48:45.610 --> 01:48:47.140
That's it. She didn't get hit.

01:48:47.170 --> 01:48:48.309
Now is the time.

01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:49.310
(Time passes without more attacks.)

01:48:49.311 --> 01:48:50.809
Footwork.

01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:52.249
- Go in there! - Go in there!

01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:53.609
- Go! - Go!

01:48:53.610 --> 01:48:55.820
- Don't rest! - The opponent is recovering!

01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:03.820
(Sae Rok keeps trying the one-two.)

01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:05.860
Keep punching.

01:49:05.861 --> 01:49:07.059
(But the wait drags on again.)

01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:08.130
Keep punching.

01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:12.470
Don't rest. Not much time remains.

01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:15.600
There you go. That's it.

01:49:15.670 --> 01:49:16.900
Keep punching hard.

01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:20.139
(Sae Rok's last one-two)

01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:21.209
That's it.

01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:22.409
(Sae Rok's last one-two)

01:49:22.410 --> 01:49:23.780
That's it.

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.579
Ten seconds!

01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:28.219
- Ten seconds! That's it! - Ten seconds!

Push.

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.290
(Fierce struggle)

01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:38.690
Stop.

Did you give it your all?

01:49:46.270 --> 01:49:47.339
Gosh, I lost.

01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:48.440
Your punches landed.

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.910
(The opponent seems to be disappointed.)

01:49:52.170 --> 01:49:56.180
(Sae Rok poured out her energy.)

01:49:57.610 --> 01:50:00.180
- Keum Sae Rok, you did well! - Keum Sae Rok, you did well!

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:02.779
(Only the result remains.)

01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:03.780
Attention.

01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:05.589
Your hands.

(It's the most nerve-racking moment.)

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:20.600
Keum Sae Rok!

01:50:20.601 --> 01:50:22.640
(This time, the cheer captain leads...)

01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:24.870
(the match of cheers.)

01:50:25.110 --> 01:50:27.270
(Will it be the opponent who pressed Sae Rok fiercely?)

01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:29.509
(Will it be Sae Rok who threw one-two punches?)

01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:31.449
- Kim Bo Min, let's go! - Let's go!

01:50:31.450 --> 01:50:33.610

01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:54.040
(Moved)

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:59.840
(Keum Sae Rok advances to the finals.)

01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:02.340
Thank you.

01:51:08.250 --> 01:51:09.579
Sae Rok, you did well.

01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:10.719
You ran out of stamina.

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:12.550
(Sae Rok, you did well.)

01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:13.920
You won.

01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:17.260
(Sae Rok shows a big smile after coming down.)

01:51:17.590 --> 01:51:18.729
She did so well.

01:51:18.730 --> 01:51:20.330
(How about the people who cheered for her?)

01:51:20.730 --> 01:51:21.829
(Crying)

01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:23.760
Seriously. She did so well.

01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:26.930
(Totally moved)

01:51:26.970 --> 01:51:28.170
She did so well.

01:51:29.070 --> 01:51:30.740
Why are you crying?

01:51:31.670 --> 01:51:34.440
Coach Ji Hoon is coaching her right away.

01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:37.079
Didn't you see your opponent stagger?

01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:38.809
- I didn't know. - With another punch,

01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:40.510
she would've gone down.

01:51:41.250 --> 01:51:42.719
Let's do more training for stamina.

01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.490
(Let's do more training for stamina!)

01:51:45.250 --> 01:51:46.449
- It's over. - It's over.

01:51:46.450 --> 01:51:48.290
- Everyone won. - Everyone won.

01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:51.030
(Iron Girls meet again.)

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:54.960
Why are you crying?

01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.400
Why are you crying?

01:51:57.670 --> 01:51:59.199
Why are you crying?

01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.399
Seriously.

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.540
(The members were as nervous as Sae Rok.)

01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:04.139
(Relieved that everyone has advanced to the finals,)

01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:05.769
Seriously, I...

01:52:05.770 --> 01:52:07.270
(they become emotional.)

01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:09.910
You won!

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:11.909
- I can't believe this is happening. - Seriously.

01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:13.680
Let's hug the coach. Let's do a group hug.

01:52:13.710 --> 01:52:15.520
We won!

01:52:15.850 --> 01:52:17.079
(Congratulations.)

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:18.889
(All members of Iron Girls advanced to the finals.)

01:52:18.890 --> 01:52:20.789
Seriously, you did so well.

01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:22.459
- All of us did it. - Seriously.

01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:24.090
This is unbelievable.

01:52:24.190 --> 01:52:25.559
This is unbelievable!

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:27.459
Coach has sweated so much.

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:28.460
I was nervous.

01:52:28.461 --> 01:52:30.700
A round of applause for Coach Ji Hoon.

01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:32.329
We should throw him in the air.

01:52:32.330 --> 01:52:33.670
- No. - He's heavy.

01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:35.170
You know,

01:52:35.370 --> 01:52:37.769
everyone did an amazing job.

01:52:37.770 --> 01:52:39.669
- This is unbelievable! - We have the future.

01:52:39.670 --> 01:52:41.180
We have the future.

01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:42.580
Thank you for your hard work.

01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:44.010
Sae Rok, thank you for your hard work.

01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:46.250
I can't believe it. What's up with Iron Girls?

01:52:46.610 --> 01:52:47.750
This is unbelievable!

01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:49.249
The boxers must be exhausted.

01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:50.319
They have a match tomorrow.

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:51.320
Let's talk...

01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:52.320
- Let's go. - as we rest in the waiting room.

01:52:52.321 --> 01:52:53.450
- Let's go. - Let's go.

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.589
We won!

01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:56.189
I can't believe it.

01:52:56.190 --> 01:52:57.319
Boxing is so much fun.

01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:58.389
It's unbelievable.

01:52:58.390 --> 01:53:00.060
- It's unbelievable. - It's so much fun.

01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:01.799
Did you foresee this result?

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:02.999
Oh, my gosh. It was this hand.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.100
I won't wash this hand.

01:53:05.070 --> 01:53:06.169
It was this hand for me.

01:53:06.170 --> 01:53:07.469
- It was this hand for me too. - To be honest, I prayed a lot.

01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:09.169
I thought I had taken a lot of punches.

01:53:09.170 --> 01:53:10.869
But I hoped that my opponent took my punches...

01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:12.609
and prayed, "Please raise my hand."

01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:13.709
"Please raise my hand."

01:53:13.710 --> 01:53:15.979
Seriously. At the front,

01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:17.749
a referee raises the plaque first.

01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:19.079
- Then your hand gets raised. - That's right.

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.880
Although I had seen the plaque,

01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:22.719
I just stood there...

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:25.219
- without taking it in. - You didn't see that it was red.

01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:26.419
No. I was in a daze.

01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:27.960
I was out of it.

01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:29.620
So, when my hand got raised,

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:30.930
I became emotional.

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:32.629
My eyes turned hot.

01:53:32.630 --> 01:53:33.689
I had tears.

01:53:33.690 --> 01:53:34.999
I felt a bit of pressure,

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.499
- because they both had won. - Right.

01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.569
- We could tell. - "What if I lose?"

01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:41.740
"What am I going to do?"

01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.869
I couldn't help but feel that way.

01:53:43.870 --> 01:53:46.809
It feels like all your hard work...

01:53:46.810 --> 01:53:48.679
- paid off. - Yes.

01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:51.079
That joy is worth investing your efforts into.

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.950
That's right. I think I screamed.

01:53:53.110 --> 01:53:54.879
There's not much besides boxing...

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:58.419
where you can feel this level of dopamine rush.

01:53:58.420 --> 01:53:59.989
- What are you going to do? - It's so fun.

01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.990
(In Ah is already addicted to boxing.)

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:02.790
We won. Let's go!

01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:04.690
We won!

01:54:04.890 --> 01:54:07.159
- Yes. - My first win ever.

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:08.799
- Gosh. - It's really incredible.

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:10.630
I'm feeling so much pressure.

01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:12.729
You know what I thought?

01:54:12.730 --> 01:54:14.270
"Gosh. The heavens helped me out."

01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:17.669
"This is fate."

01:54:17.670 --> 01:54:19.810
- Right. - The heavens gave us...

01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:21.839
this opportunity so that all four of us can fight tomorrow.

01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:25.580
To be honest, I wouldn't care if you lose tomorrow.

01:54:25.810 --> 01:54:29.179
You all showed me your best efforts today,

01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:30.180
so I'm pleased with that.

01:54:30.181 --> 01:54:31.749
- We'll do our best tomorrow too. - Just do your best.

01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:33.489
- Okay. - Got it? Good.

01:54:33.490 --> 01:54:36.560
For four champions. Two, three.

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.259
- KO! - Iron!

01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.960
- Girls! - Girls!

01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:44.929
I'm going all out tomorrow.

01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:46.730
(Will there be a champion among the Iron Girls?)

01:54:47.166 --> 01:54:50.076
(This is the beginning.)

01:54:50.676 --> 01:54:53.176
(The long-awaited final match is here.)

01:54:54.076 --> 01:54:56.875
(They're full of...)

01:54:56.876 --> 01:55:01.586
(nerves and fear.)

01:55:03.016 --> 01:55:04.686
(I want to win.)

01:55:04.926 --> 01:55:06.956
(I refuse to lose.)

01:55:08.096 --> 01:55:15.436
(It's time to have faith in the hard work they put in.)

01:55:15.666 --> 01:55:18.466
(Let’s fight a match we won’t regret.)

01:55:19.836 --> 01:55:21.266
(Let’s go out in flames.)

01:55:21.406 --> 01:55:23.536
(The much-anticipated finals)

01:55:26.206 --> 01:55:28.775
(Just one match away...)

01:55:28.776 --> 01:55:32.416
(from the championship)

01:55:36.416 --> 01:55:37.556
No.

01:55:38.656 --> 01:55:42.995
(The final match of the Iron Girls)

01:55:42.996 --> 01:55:48.996
(What happened?)
