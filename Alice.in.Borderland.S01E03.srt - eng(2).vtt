00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.166
That woman…

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:43.877
I killed her.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.468
Everyone was forced to play the game.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.137
It wasn't your fault.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:59.559
What the hell is all this?

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:04.856
Who knows? I know I don't.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:06.649
But…

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.237
It amazes me
that I'm willing to do anything

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.656
just so that I can survive.

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:19.996
If we didn't want to do that,
we might as well just die.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.474
My visa ends today.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.903
{\an8}I worked so hard.
Did everything to get into that company.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.324
I even hooked up with someone I hated.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.120
And I finally got the promotion.

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:09.999
Saori…

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.876
I talked to the HR department.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:17.799
{\an8}Cypher Bank Holdings
strongly recommends Saori Shibuki

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:21.302
as the new team leader of AI development.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.514
SPECIAL PROMOTION FOR ASSISTANT
IN THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:27.976
I'll survive this game

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.812
and return to my original life.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.316
Arisu! Karube!

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:36.859
I can't believe it!

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.906
I was so worried
when you guys weren't back this morning.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.075
It's so good to see you!

00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:46.160
Hey, Chota.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.745
Easy.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.289
Are you hurt?

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.291
I'm okay.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.712
Somebody radioed in?

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.297
Yeah.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:02.844
Thanks.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.974
If we go to that Beach place,

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.268
we might be able to find something.

00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:13.271
Like where everyone in the city
disappeared to?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.898
Maybe there's an evacuation shelter.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.443
Maybe everybody's there.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.156
The closest beaches to us are
in Shonan, Izu, and Ito, right?

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.491
They're so far.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.953
But we can reach them in time.

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:32.206
So, what do we think?

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.042
Should we try going?

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.085
My vote is…

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.756
for now, we trust whoever this is.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.092
And how is Chota supposed to go?

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.804
That's a good point.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.183
And our visas…

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.478
they expire today.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.026
Then we'll have to win the game today

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.320
and extend your visas.

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:03.571
Sound good?

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.741
Then we'll go and look for
the Beach tomorrow.

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:25.426
I'll go to the Beach.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.471
No matter what happens.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.225
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.481
We have to believe there's hope.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:57.625
It amazes me
that I'm willing to do anything

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.962
in order to survive.

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:07.427
If only we could choose to die
on our own terms.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:23.943
Arisu?

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.034
What's the matter?

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.834
Nothing.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.055
Say something.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.477
"Say something"? Like what?

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.938
Hm, let's see. Heard any gossip?

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:07.862
I saw someone die right in front of me.

00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:12.158
But I survived.

00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:16.287
So what should I say?

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.165
That you were glad.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.462
Glad it wasn't you.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.051
I didn't think about that, but…

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:35.806
Guess I was.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.478
All I thought about was surviving.

00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:49.237
Yeah, I get it. I'll tell you something.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.908
On my very first game day,

00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:56.118
everyone died except me.

00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:02.458
I didn't wanna die like them.

00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:06.254
What I wanted…

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.757
What I wanted was to survive.

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:34.991
And… found it!

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.094
Please be safe and all right.

00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:11.986
SHIBUYA STATION

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:16.073
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:24.582
He's late.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:27.418
Yeah, should we just go?

00:10:28.252 --> 00:10:30.046
No, we wait for Karube.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.174
If we don't join the game,
we could all die.

00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:38.304
Chota, let's go.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.016
They both have days left on their visa.

00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:55.029
Karube!

00:10:57.114 --> 00:10:58.157
Sorry.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.618
- I needed to get something.
- What do you mean, "sorry"?

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.083
Shibuki and I…

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.377
For us, there's no tomorrow.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.381
Why, what's going on?

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:15.841
Don't be angry.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.182
We're wasting time. Let's go.

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:26.268
Come on.

00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:29.063
Thank you.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:33.544
Let's do this.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:52.104

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:28.766
FEEL FREE TO USE ANY OF THESE

00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:30.768
Are we gonna tear something apart?

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.562
Huh…

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:40.528
- This one.
- Huh.

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:43.072
Those look kinda cool.

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.118
What the…

00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:03.384
{\an8}FACE RECOGNITION IN PROGRESS
PLEASE WAIT FOR A MOMENT

00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:09.598
Entries accepted.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.854
{\an8}WELCOME! SPONSORED BY
SHINJUKU NATURAL BOTANICAL GARDEN

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:19.275
Put on the goggles
and proceed to the garden.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.617
THIS WAY

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.437
REGISTRATION IN PROGRESS
CURRENT PARTICIPANTS

00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:02.818
What is this?

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:08.282
My goggles recognized Chota
and the target cursor turned red.

00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:10.200
Yeah, when we look at each other.

00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:11.952
It must be a tracking function.

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.747
What do they want us to do this time?

00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:18.125
Registration is now closed.

00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:19.793
The game will now commence.

00:15:20.377 --> 00:15:23.589
Difficulty, Seven of Hearts.

00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:25.007
Hearts.

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.842
Hearts? Isn't that…

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.471
The suit of the playing cards
usually means

00:15:30.554 --> 00:15:32.139
what kind of game it's gonna be.

00:15:32.222 --> 00:15:35.142
Clubs is a team battle.
Diamonds is your wits.

00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:36.810
And as for Hearts…

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:40.147
You play with people's hearts
and you tear them apart.

00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:42.900
Seven. Isn't that kinda difficult?

00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:45.694
Hearts are the worst.

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:46.820
What do we do?

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:51.533
Game, "Hide-and-seek".

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:54.370
Rules. One person will be the wolf

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:57.122
and the other three will be the lambs.

00:15:57.206 --> 00:16:01.251
A lamb found by the wolf
will become the next wolf

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:04.380
and must hide so that
the wolf does not find them.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.215
Clear condition.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:09.760
Player who is the wolf at game's end
is the winner.

00:16:09.843 --> 00:16:11.971
Time limit, 15 minutes.

00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:14.014
When 15 minutes have passed,

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.851
the collars fastened to the lambs' necks
will explode.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.061
What?

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:21.021
"Explode"?

00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:23.273
What does she mean?

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.610
Do you know what this means?

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:28.779
Know what?

00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:32.241
This means only one player will survive.

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:34.410
What?

00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:37.246
We'll play hide-and-seek…

00:16:38.747 --> 00:16:41.000
Whoever's the wolf
at the end of the game wins.

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:43.335
The other three will be dead.

00:16:44.753 --> 00:16:46.588
It's really very simple.

00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:51.677
The first wolf is ID number

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:57.599
1000247.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:59.518
Chota Segawa.

00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:07.234
Really?

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.528
Game time limit.

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:13.615
Fifteen minutes, commence.

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:27.212
Stop it, Chota! If you try to take it off,
the collar might explode!

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.339
- I don't care!
- Stop it!

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.091
Leave me alone!

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:38.390
Arisu?

00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:50.527
When we lock eyes,
the wolf role is passed on.

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:52.821
That's the catch in this game.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:55.991
If the wolf doesn't survive,

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.077
it's because the lambs killed it.

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.579
What do we do, Arisu?

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:04.541
It's bullshit!

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:12.841
Shibuki!

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.427
The one that needs to hide
in this game is the wolf!

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:18.347
- Are we going to die?
- You will if you do nothing.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.598
But I'll be fine.

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:21.225
Shibuki!

00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:22.142
Karube!

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:32.736
Stop running!

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.120
Shibuki!

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.009
TROPICAL RAINFOREST

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.621
Come out!

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:28.375
Shibuki!

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.061
Ah!

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:59.489
Can you read me, Shibuki?

00:20:00.657 --> 00:20:01.992
Shibuki!

00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:03.827
Stop running.

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:06.830
Let's think of a way out of this together.

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.790
I'm sorry.

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:10.542
I'm sorry.

00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:18.884
There's no point apologizing now, huh?

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:20.344
Huh?

00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:22.721
Turn around!

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:24.765
Stop it, Karube!

00:20:24.848 --> 00:20:26.642
Come on, come on!

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.687
Turn around!

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:11.770
You fucking bitch!

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:18.443
Karube!

00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:25.033
Arisu!

00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:28.370
Both of you, enough! Stop it!

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:31.206
If we work together,
we might be able to figure this out!

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.001
You're so naive, this is a Hearts game!

00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:46.471
What's happening to us?

00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:51.643
You're turning against each other!

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:52.978
Damn you, Arisu!

00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:55.355
We're friends, right?

00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:01.361
Ten minutes remaining.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:05.991
Arisu!

00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:07.826
O Holy Mother…

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.120
Please forgive us

00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:12.247
- for our mortal sins.
- Arisu!

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.917
Our smiles are the light of hope.

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:19.921
And you, Holy Mother, appear to us
when we smile.

00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:23.133
O Holy Mother…

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:26.053
- Please forgive us…
- Arisu!

00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:27.596
…for our mortal sins…

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:31.641
Our smiles are the light of hope.

00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:36.188
And you, Holy Mother, appear to us
when we smile.

00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:44.529
O Holy Mother…

00:22:45.947 --> 00:22:48.325
Our smiles are the light of hope.

00:22:49.659 --> 00:22:52.287
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:01.880
Do you want to live or die?

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:03.965
All I need is some time!

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.843
I'll think of a way
to get out of this game!

00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:08.887
You'll think of a way out, huh?

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:14.017
You just want to be the only survivor.

00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:18.522
It doesn't matter to you if you're dead.

00:23:20.315 --> 00:23:21.566
Make me the wolf.

00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:24.069
Your life is shit anyway!

00:23:25.695 --> 00:23:30.117
Where's the justice when someone
who has the desire to live dies?

00:23:32.035 --> 00:23:33.120
Arisu.

00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:37.666
We can't all survive in this game!

00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:49.719
Chota!

00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:52.556
- Let me go!
- Go! Run!

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:55.725
Let me go!

00:23:57.185 --> 00:23:58.395
Stop!

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.777
Let me go!

00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:08.738
I took care of you!

00:24:09.322 --> 00:24:11.783
You don't know
what your friends really are!

00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:13.743
Let me go!

00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:16.079
Let me go!

00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:18.790
- O Holy Mother…
- Let me go!

00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:24.838
Eight minutes remaining.

00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.884
Let go!

00:24:38.226 --> 00:24:39.978
Arisu!

00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:46.610
Where are you, Arisu? Come out!

00:24:47.903 --> 00:24:49.362
Come on, damn it.

00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:53.074
You're just gonna hide
until time runs out?

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:54.576
Ugh, shit!

00:24:57.245 --> 00:24:59.372
Come on, Arisu.

00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:01.374
You were playing us all.

00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:05.837
And you said
it'll work out if we cooperate.

00:25:08.089 --> 00:25:11.551
From the very start of this,
you wanted to be the only survivor!

00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:04.062
I don't know what to do.

00:26:04.145 --> 00:26:06.690
Get off of me!

00:26:06.773 --> 00:26:07.691
I'm sorry.

00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:10.026
I'm sorry!

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.614
Ha!
What's the use of saying sorry?

00:26:14.698 --> 00:26:16.157
Arisu!

00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:21.246
In the end, that's…

00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:22.414
all you ever do.

00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:30.171
Ever since
you dropped out of school…

00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:35.844
All you do is say sorry!

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:37.929
- Arisu!
- I'm sorry.

00:26:38.555 --> 00:26:39.639
I'm sorry!

00:26:40.807 --> 00:26:41.933
I'm sorry.

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:52.402
Congratulations
on your acceptance, Hajime.

00:26:52.485 --> 00:26:54.821
You really accomplished something.

00:26:54.904 --> 00:26:56.990
I know your mother would be happy too.

00:26:57.073 --> 00:26:59.618
And this is just the beginning.

00:27:01.244 --> 00:27:03.747
I'll see it through.
I don't want to end up like Ryohei.

00:27:04.372 --> 00:27:08.126
I can't teach Ryohei anything,
but you're different.

00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:09.919
Inside you, there's ambition.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.173
You're very different from your brother.

00:27:15.842 --> 00:27:18.595
Ryohei, why don't you come over
and join us?

00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:34.069
If you're happy being a loser…

00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:38.281
…then let me be the wolf!

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:44.663
Arisu!

00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:56.341
Five minutes remaining.

00:27:58.551 --> 00:28:00.053
I've had enough.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:06.476
I don't care who survives in the end.

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:12.524
But…

00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:17.696
But I don't want it to end this way.

00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:42.721
Is this about Arisu and Chota again?

00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:52.063
You know, you really are very kind.

00:29:37.734 --> 00:29:39.319
I don't expect anything from you

00:29:39.402 --> 00:29:41.571
and you never fail to disappoint me
in that regard.

00:29:43.239 --> 00:29:44.365
So, did you…

00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:34.374
This noodle is so good!

00:30:39.462 --> 00:30:41.172
You look like you can't eat noodles…

00:30:45.301 --> 00:30:46.386
Come on, man!

00:30:47.262 --> 00:30:49.138
Come on, Karube, faster!

00:31:10.994 --> 00:31:12.161
Guys.

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:17.750
I got this… dream.

00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:22.255
I wanna buy a huge farm in Australia.

00:31:23.423 --> 00:31:28.511
Then I'll invite you guys over,
and we'll drink beer in the morning.

00:31:28.595 --> 00:31:30.221
That sounds nice!

00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:32.765
And I'll deliver
triple grade-A steaks to you

00:31:32.849 --> 00:31:35.518
with my drone delivery service.

00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:38.563
My drones will be fully automated,
I'll develop an app for them!

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:43.610
All right then.
Cheers to our future.

00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:44.861
Cheers!

00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:46.946
You better keep your promise,
you hear?

00:32:38.748 --> 00:32:40.917
Three minutes remaining.

00:32:53.429 --> 00:32:56.140
Guys, I'll… quit.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.689
I'll… drop out of this game.

00:33:06.275 --> 00:33:07.860
You're all…

00:33:09.278 --> 00:33:11.280
You're all that matters to me.

00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:16.494
If someone has to lose at this game…

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:19.998
…let it be me.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.294
I'm leaving the game.

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:32.051
Karube? Chota? Karube.

00:33:35.763 --> 00:33:37.557
Karube, Chota?

00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:46.232
Karube!

00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:48.234
Chota!

00:33:49.152 --> 00:33:52.363
Guys!

00:33:55.825 --> 00:33:56.909
Chota!

00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:00.038
Chota!

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:03.082
Where are you?

00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:04.208
Chota!

00:34:11.799 --> 00:34:14.010
Chota!

00:34:16.804 --> 00:34:17.930
Chota?

00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:20.892
Where are you?

00:34:20.975 --> 00:34:23.561
Chota!

00:34:23.644 --> 00:34:26.564
YOU BECOME THE WOLF IF YOU ARE FOUND.
HIDE SO THAT THE WOLF WON'T FIND YOU.

00:34:27.148 --> 00:34:28.232
Karube!

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.610
Chota!

00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:35.031
Come out! Let's talk!

00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:37.450
Guys!

00:34:38.201 --> 00:34:41.120
HIDE SO THAT THE WOLF WON'T FIND YOU

00:34:46.709 --> 00:34:49.378
Karube! Where are you?

00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:53.716
Why won't you guys answer me?

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:58.096
Karube!

00:35:02.225 --> 00:35:06.145
HIDE WELL, LAMB

00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:08.523
Where are you guys?

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:11.067
Karube!

00:35:13.986 --> 00:35:15.279
Chota!

00:35:18.241 --> 00:35:19.534
Chota!

00:35:21.536 --> 00:35:23.079
Karube!

00:35:23.162 --> 00:35:25.248
Come out, please!

00:35:25.998 --> 00:35:27.917
Stop yelling.

00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:31.254
Karube!

00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:42.390
Always laughing like idiots,

00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:45.309
drinking the night away…

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.355
When I'm with you guys,

00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:52.275
I forget about all my problems.

00:35:54.068 --> 00:35:55.862
Hey, do you guys remember?

00:35:55.945 --> 00:35:59.740
That fricking hot day
when we made noodles with shaved ice?

00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:02.493
Karube, where are you?

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.913
Karube!

00:36:09.792 --> 00:36:12.336
We laughed a lot that day, didn't we?

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:16.966
Chota?

00:36:17.049 --> 00:36:20.094
Chota laughed so hard
that noodles came out from his nose.

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:24.932
I thought we said
we'd keep that our secret.

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:26.976
Where are you, Chota?

00:36:27.643 --> 00:36:28.853
Karube!

00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:31.522
Arisu.

00:36:33.482 --> 00:36:34.817
Live for us.

00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:47.038
Karube!

00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:48.581
Chota!

00:36:48.664 --> 00:36:51.042
Thirty seconds remaining.

00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:03.888
It can't be me!

00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:06.599
I shouldn't be the one to live!

00:37:07.808 --> 00:37:09.101
Twenty seconds.

00:37:09.185 --> 00:37:10.353
I'm behind you.

00:37:14.982 --> 00:37:16.234
I'm sorry.

00:37:16.984 --> 00:37:19.320
I'm sorry, Shibuki.

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:22.073
- Ten seconds.
- Arisu.

00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:25.409
Thank you.

00:37:25.493 --> 00:37:29.080
- Five, four, three, two…
- Karube!

00:37:29.163 --> 00:37:30.998
- …one.
- Karube!
