00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:20.935
(Finally, the first tournament)

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:22.475
Uie's opponent...

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:26.145
(Uie's opponent was suddenly disqualified.)

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:29.115
(Uie decided to prepare for the finals.)

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:34.485
(The other members prepared for their matches.)

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:37.984
In the Red Corner, Iron Girls' Seol In Ah.

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:41.595
(Finally, the tournament begins)

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:45.065
Keep going, In Ah.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:46.835
Three.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:48.395
What? It's a knockout.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:50.805
Go after her. There you go.

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:53.174
Her willpower is insane.

00:00:53.175 --> 00:00:54.615
(Iron Girls poured in their effort.)

00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:55.935
There you go.

00:00:55.936 --> 00:00:57.274
Yes. Block it.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:00:59.875
(After a fierce back-and-forth, )

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:05.085
(all members of Iron Girls advanced to the final.)

00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:06.454
We won!

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:09.525
(Will they be able to win in the final as well?)

00:01:10.255 --> 00:01:12.324
(The day of the final of the boxing tournament)

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:13.824
- Hello. - Hello.

00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:14.854
- Hello. - Hello.

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:16.595
- Hello. - Hello.

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:18.794
- Captain, save me. - What's wrong?

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:19.795
- Uie. - My first match will be...

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:21.835
- the final. - You'll have the first match today.

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:24.205
- How did this happen? - The first match.

00:01:24.235 --> 00:01:25.534
Yesterday,

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:27.634
you were well-rested and in the best condition.

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:30.645
- She woke up at 2am today. - She woke up at 2am.

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:33.114
When I lay down on the sofa in the living room,

00:01:33.115 --> 00:01:34.174
my heartbeats were like the club music.

00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:35.244
(Boom, boom)

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:37.044
I could hear them.

00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:39.514
You can tell that she hasn't slept, right?

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:41.055
She's haggard.

00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:42.184
She's like how we were yesterday.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:45.684
Uie, although you're nervous now,

00:01:45.685 --> 00:01:49.224
I'm sure that your routine will come out as the time approaches.

00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:50.364
- Of course. - Okay.

00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:51.685
Would you loosen your grip a bit?

00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:52.834
(Iron grip)

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:53.835
- It's natural to be nervous. - She has an iron grip.

00:01:53.836 --> 00:01:55.564
- She has an iron grip. - You're alone in this situation.

00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:57.245
- That's right. - So, it's understandable.

00:01:57.365 --> 00:01:58.565
Uie, you'll do well.

00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:01.134
The other three members had a match before.

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:02.704
- I'm more nervous today. - Are you more nervous?

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:03.744
- Of course. - The thing is,

00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:05.474
- I'm more nervous today as well. - Why?

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:07.615
Now, I want to do well.

00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:10.215
I saw my opponent yesterday.

00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:11.814
Instead of being nervous,

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:13.014
- I'm just... - You're scared, right?

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:14.015
(You're scared, right?)

00:02:14.016 --> 00:02:15.085
I'm like, "Let's survive!"

00:02:15.415 --> 00:02:16.525
It's a survival.

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:18.924
(Ju Hyun watched the match of her opponent for the final.)

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:20.195
The boxer in red.

00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:21.524
She's Ju Hyun's opponent.

00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:22.794
Watch the boxer in red carefully.

00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:24.115
Watch the boxer in red carefully.

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:27.195
- What? - Gosh. What's that?

00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:30.205
(The boxer from the red corner charged at her opponent.)

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:32.605
(She had the attacking style of charging endlessly.)

00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:34.374
Her stamina is insane.

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:35.504
(The incessant attacks scared her.)

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:36.745
Is she a zombie?

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:38.644
Ju Hyun, you'll have a big match tomorrow.

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:39.874
You'll have a big match.

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:40.914
(She had a big match planned for the final.)

00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:41.915
What?

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:43.414
"Let's not get devoured."

00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:45.084
- It'll be neck-and-neck. - The match of the century.

00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:47.485
If you box like you did yesterday, you'll win a gold medal.

00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:49.014
Her attacking pattern was too simple.

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:50.924
You just need to avoid falling into that simple trap.

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:51.954
- Really? - Yes.

00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:55.954
However, since this is the final, you need to stay a bit more alert.

00:02:55.955 --> 00:02:57.524
- Okay. - Keep that in mind.

00:02:57.525 --> 00:02:58.525
All right.

00:02:58.526 --> 00:03:01.265
Now, I'll share the order of your matches.

00:03:01.595 --> 00:03:02.664
- Seol In Ah, - Yes?

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:03.735
You're number five.

00:03:03.765 --> 00:03:05.504
Park Ju Hyun, you're number eight.

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:07.504
- Uie, you're number nine. - What?

00:03:07.505 --> 00:03:08.975
Keum Sae Rok, you're number ten.

00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:10.804
I can't believe it.

00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:13.575
(Their matches will be back-to-back.)

00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:16.545
(The order of their matches in the preliminary round)

00:03:16.585 --> 00:03:17.614
(Number 32, number 36, number 39, number 41)

00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:18.844
(3 matches)

00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:20.284
(2 matches)

00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:22.454
(1 match)

00:03:22.455 --> 00:03:25.725
(There were matches in between.)

00:03:26.025 --> 00:03:28.555
(Today, three members' matches are back-to-back.)

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:29.965
It's the very next match.

00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:33.364
The coach and the boxer...

00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:36.604
usually chat while watching the previous match, right?

00:03:36.605 --> 00:03:37.664
When this happens, they can't do that.

00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:39.265
The boxer needs to get ready by herself.

00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:41.975
(Yesterday, during the preliminary round.)

00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:44.805
(the members were on standby with the coach.)

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:48.275
(However, they must be on standby alone.)

00:03:48.575 --> 00:03:50.895
(It's bad news for Uie who'll have her first match today.)

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:52.784
- What will you do, Uie? - It's okay.

00:03:52.785 --> 00:03:54.814
- I can do it. - You should have that experience.

00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:56.385
- Got it. - Oh, no.

00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:58.284
Still, it's Uie's first match.

00:03:58.285 --> 00:03:59.895
- It's okay. - Uie will do well.

00:03:59.955 --> 00:04:01.654
Let's go inside...

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:03.724
- and eat before we warm up. - We need to eat.

00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:05.494
- Let's eat and get ready. - Let's hurry up.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.694
- Let's go. - Okay. Today as well,

00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:08.364
- let's avoid injuries and have fun. - Let's go.

00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:09.534
Let's do this. Let's go.

00:04:09.535 --> 00:04:10.664
Let's go.

00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:13.305
(1 hour before the boxing tournament begins)

00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:15.004
I'm nervous.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:16.881
(Iron Girls change into their uniforms after a meal.)

00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:20.144
(While the three who experienced the preliminary round get ready)

00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:21.215
It's okay.

00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:24.315
The best in Seoul.

00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:25.845
(Uie changes into her uniform for the first time.)

00:04:25.846 --> 00:04:27.585
Finally, Uie will have her first match.

00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:29.984
It's my first time wearing the uniform.

00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:31.985
It's nice.

00:04:33.155 --> 00:04:37.425
(She checks the headgear ahead of time.)

00:04:38.295 --> 00:04:42.295
(After checking the strength of the hits, )

00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:46.975
(she begins to wrap her hands.)

00:04:47.505 --> 00:04:51.145
I can't wrap my hands because they're shaking.

00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:52.874
(Shaking)

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:54.745
(She manages to calm her mind.)

00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:57.714
Let's come down from the ring without any regrets.

00:04:57.715 --> 00:04:59.595
(They're busy getting ready for their matches.)

00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:02.555
Let's come down from the ring without any regrets.

00:05:02.655 --> 00:05:03.924
- Ju Hyun, what are you doing? - I got this.

00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:05.325
That's insane.

00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:07.235
She's applying the undereye eyeliner.

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:10.325
(Fierce)

00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:12.795
(Let's not lose in terms of gaze.)

00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:14.515
(Is there eyeliner for intimidation?)

00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:17.005
(I'll draw it this thick.)

00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:20.775
(She planned the intimidation method over ten days ago.)

00:05:21.535 --> 00:05:23.374
(What do you think? Do I look strong?)

00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:24.375
Do I look strong?

00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:26.775
Hey, it's no joke. You look scary.

00:05:27.175 --> 00:05:28.175
That's good.

00:05:28.175 --> 00:05:29.175
That's good.

00:05:29.815 --> 00:05:30.945
That's good.

00:05:31.315 --> 00:05:33.885
(She's ready.)

00:05:33.985 --> 00:05:35.654
(2025 Seoul Boxing Association President's Cup Boxing Tournament)

00:05:35.655 --> 00:05:37.985
(30 minutes before the boxing tournament begins)

00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:44.525
(Other boxers begin to warm up.)

00:05:45.825 --> 00:05:48.165
(The first match of the final begins.)

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:51.535
(As a fierce match takes place, )

00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:55.475
(Iron Girls begin to warm up.)

00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:07.184
There you go. After a jab comes a two.

00:06:07.185 --> 00:06:08.185
There you go.

00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:09.185
Hook, jab.

00:06:09.186 --> 00:06:10.755
- Pivot, jab. - There you go.

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:12.024
- Shuffle, - Shuffle.

00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:13.325
- jab, jab. - Jab. There you go.

00:06:14.325 --> 00:06:15.325
(In Ah will go first.)

00:06:15.326 --> 00:06:16.464
Don't go overboard.

00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:17.695
(In Ah will go first.)

00:06:18.325 --> 00:06:20.795
Have confidence in your fists.

00:06:20.965 --> 00:06:22.534
Have confidence in your fists.

00:06:22.535 --> 00:06:24.565
(She seems to be very nervous.)

00:06:25.705 --> 00:06:31.875
(In the preliminary round, In Ah's opponent showed strong punches.)

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:32.975
- Coach. - It's okay.

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.615
She's good.

00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:35.874
The boxer in red is better.

00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:37.521
- The boxer in red will win. - She seems sturdy.

00:06:37.545 --> 00:06:39.785
The boxer in red has a good guard.

00:06:40.115 --> 00:06:41.315
When she goes in...

00:06:41.915 --> 00:06:42.954
Does she have heavy punches?

00:06:42.955 --> 00:06:44.395
She's the type to go for infighting.

00:06:45.885 --> 00:06:46.994
I'm so nervous.

00:06:46.995 --> 00:06:48.124
- What? - I'm so nervous.

00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:49.525
Are you nervous? It's okay.

00:06:50.295 --> 00:06:52.064
- There's no need to be nervous. - She's good at this.

00:06:52.065 --> 00:06:53.095
This.

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:55.465
When she does that, pivot.

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:57.134
(They practice right away.)

00:06:57.135 --> 00:06:58.204
Then this will happen.

00:06:58.205 --> 00:06:59.905
- Will I be able to see it? - Yes. Listen.

00:07:00.005 --> 00:07:01.435
When she does this, just pivot.

00:07:02.135 --> 00:07:03.305
Doing that will be enough.

00:07:03.775 --> 00:07:04.974
Please save me.

00:07:04.975 --> 00:07:06.044

(Right next to them, Ju Hyun's dad is ready to cheer.)

00:07:57.495 --> 00:07:59.865
(Dad, you're here.)

00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:02.935
(Uie and Ju Hyun feel less nervous thanks to their cheers.)

00:08:03.635 --> 00:08:06.405

(She steels her heart until the end.)

00:08:33.465 --> 00:08:34.734

00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:40.174
Let's go, Seol In Ah!

00:08:40.175 --> 00:08:41.205

(She wore the headgear many times, )

00:08:59.895 --> 00:09:04.465
(but the final feels different.)

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:06.734
Since this will be the last match,

00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:08.635
- shall we tighten the gloves? - Okay.

00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:10.911
- Isn't it better to tighten them? - Yes, it is.

00:09:10.935 --> 00:09:11.965
Afterward,

I can do it.

00:09:20.315 --> 00:09:22.245
I even survived the tough training.

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:24.985
Think of it as punching a sandbag.

00:09:25.715 --> 00:09:27.635
- Shadowbox. - Don't get intimidated. It's okay.

00:09:27.915 --> 00:09:29.484

That's right. You've trained a lot.

00:09:34.355 --> 00:09:35.995
Do you want to put on the headgear first?

There you go.

00:10:06.185 --> 00:10:07.424
There you go. Then...

00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:09.025
That will come in handy. Go ahead.

00:10:09.695 --> 00:10:10.765
There you go.

00:10:11.165 --> 00:10:12.465
That's what you need to do.

(As she takes deep breaths, she goes over the techniques.)

00:10:16.935 --> 00:10:18.005
I can do it.

00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:19.835
I can do it. Let's come out as ash.

00:10:20.275 --> 00:10:21.805
I'll just collapse in the ring.

00:10:22.475 --> 00:10:23.745
I'll pour out all of my energy.

(She takes her first step into the ring for the final.)

00:11:23.195 --> 00:11:24.904
Just stay calm and give it your all.

00:11:24.905 --> 00:11:27.805
You don't have to overdo it, though.

00:11:28.175 --> 00:11:30.045
Okay? Don't rush things.

It was good.

00:14:01.855 --> 00:14:03.994
Even your hooks landed well, right?

00:14:03.995 --> 00:14:06.265
You wait too long after a jab.

00:14:06.365 --> 00:14:08.334
Just throw a one-two and a jab.

00:14:08.335 --> 00:14:09.795

- She has a long reach, so... - I know.

00:14:16.735 --> 00:14:18.304
I told you to just avoid her front hand.

00:14:18.305 --> 00:14:19.804
You can dodge and punch.

00:14:19.805 --> 00:14:21.315
You made good cross-counters.

00:14:21.345 --> 00:14:22.544
Keep side-stepping.

00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:25.105
If your punches don't land, weave and retreat to the side. Okay?

00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:26.245
You can do this.

00:14:27.085 --> 00:14:28.685
She was a little outplayed in Round One.

00:14:29.855 --> 00:14:31.415
She has to show something in Round Two.

00:14:32.185 --> 00:14:33.545
There wasn't much of a difference.

00:14:33.695 --> 00:14:35.395
The opponent is really strong.

00:14:35.655 --> 00:14:36.964
In Ah is doing a great job.

00:14:36.965 --> 00:14:39.165
(In Ah is doing well against a strong opponent.)

00:14:39.565 --> 00:14:41.664
- Try a high-low combination. - Okay.

00:14:41.665 --> 00:14:42.911
(In Ah needs to show her prowess in Round 2.)

00:14:42.935 --> 00:14:44.264
- Seol In Ah! - Seol In Ah!

00:14:44.265 --> 00:14:46.505
- Go, Seol In Ah! - Let's go!

00:14:47.375 --> 00:14:50.245
(The members are watching her.)

00:14:51.005 --> 00:14:52.044
I can do this.

00:14:52.045 --> 00:14:54.315
(I can do this.)

00:14:55.245 --> 00:14:57.385
(She pulls herself together and does her footwork.)

00:14:58.515 --> 00:14:59.515
Ready.

00:14:59.516 --> 00:15:01.154
- All right. You're the best, In Ah. - Box.

00:15:01.155 --> 00:15:02.635
- You're the best. - You can do this.

00:15:02.855 --> 00:15:05.225
(Simba Seol steps up again.)

00:15:05.885 --> 00:15:07.354
(Round 2, Under 54kg: Kim Yeo Jin versus Seol In Ah)

00:15:07.355 --> 00:15:09.295
It's the last round. Watch out for body shots.

00:15:09.725 --> 00:15:11.865
- Good. - That's it.

00:15:12.225 --> 00:15:13.935
- One, two... - Well done!

00:15:14.995 --> 00:15:17.204
(A perfect right hook)

00:15:17.205 --> 00:15:19.565
(A jab followed.)

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:26.105
(The right hook landed perfectly.)

00:15:26.745 --> 00:15:28.774
- There you go! - Stop.

00:15:28.775 --> 00:15:30.715
(A standing eight count for the Red Corner)

00:15:31.285 --> 00:15:32.444
It's a standing eight count.

00:15:32.445 --> 00:15:34.055
The opponent got a clean hit.

00:15:34.415 --> 00:15:35.685
Stop. Take a step forward.

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:37.984
Good job. Wait over there.

00:15:37.985 --> 00:15:39.184
(Standing 8 count: If a boxer is judged...)

00:15:39.185 --> 00:15:40.424
(unable to continue safely, the referee counts...)

00:15:40.425 --> 00:15:41.924
(from 1 to 8 to determine whether the match can go on.)

00:15:41.925 --> 00:15:43.471
(Failure to recover within the count may result in a K.O.)

00:15:43.495 --> 00:15:45.425
(After checking the boxer's condition, )

00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:47.465
Step forward. Box.

00:15:47.535 --> 00:15:49.495
(the match resumes.)

00:15:50.465 --> 00:15:53.264
(In Ah keeps the momentum going and attacks first.)

00:15:53.265 --> 00:15:55.475
- Go. - Jab and go in.

00:15:55.605 --> 00:15:57.005
Keep going. Good.

00:15:57.475 --> 00:15:58.575
You're doing well.

00:15:58.645 --> 00:16:01.715
- Go, Seol In Ah! - Go, Seol In Ah!

00:16:02.475 --> 00:16:03.885
Again. That's it.

00:16:04.245 --> 00:16:05.384
That's it. Good!

00:16:05.385 --> 00:16:07.184
Circle around. There you go.

00:16:07.185 --> 00:16:08.985
Yes! Turn around.

00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:10.155
Good.

00:16:10.985 --> 00:16:16.925
(In Ah's straight flurry)

00:16:18.365 --> 00:16:19.824
- Good. - Circle around.

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:21.265
(The opponent's right hook)

00:16:21.895 --> 00:16:24.604
(A fierce slugfest)

00:16:24.605 --> 00:16:27.104
- Get out of it. - There you go. Nice.

00:16:27.105 --> 00:16:28.235
That's it!

00:16:30.105 --> 00:16:34.045
(A powerful right hook)

00:16:34.415 --> 00:16:35.974
Good. That's it!

00:16:35.975 --> 00:16:37.585
(And a body shot follows.)

00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:38.944
Good.

00:16:38.945 --> 00:16:40.184
(In Ah lands a series of valid strikes.)

00:16:40.185 --> 00:16:42.985
You're almost there. You're doing a good job.

00:16:43.685 --> 00:16:45.724
- She's coming in. - Go, In Ah.

00:16:45.725 --> 00:16:47.325
Continue your footwork. Good.

00:16:48.555 --> 00:16:50.224
All right. You're doing well.

00:16:50.225 --> 00:16:51.894
Punch. You should counter a cross. That's it.

00:16:51.895 --> 00:16:54.765
(The opponent forces In Ah into a corner, allowing punches.)

00:16:58.165 --> 00:17:00.705
(Body shot)

00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:04.645
(A right hook)

00:17:05.505 --> 00:17:08.344
(In Ah tries to escape, )

00:17:08.345 --> 00:17:11.045
(but she is once again cornered by a fierce attack.)

00:17:11.785 --> 00:17:15.015
(After the opponent's one-two, )

00:17:16.815 --> 00:17:19.925
(In Ah allows another valid strike with her guard down.)

00:17:20.525 --> 00:17:22.795
(She calls up her last reserves of strength to defend.)

00:17:23.025 --> 00:17:24.394
Ten seconds.

00:17:24.395 --> 00:17:25.571
(There's less than 10 seconds left.)

00:17:25.595 --> 00:17:26.795
No, In Ah.

00:17:27.235 --> 00:17:29.795
- Good. Circle around. - Get out of it.

00:17:33.505 --> 00:17:40.105
(The opponent's valid strikes)

00:17:40.475 --> 00:17:42.144
Get out of it, In Ah.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.145
Stop.

00:17:48.285 --> 00:17:50.825
(In Ah collapses to the ground.)

00:17:50.885 --> 00:17:51.925
Stop.

00:17:58.865 --> 00:17:59.895
Hang on.

00:18:00.165 --> 00:18:04.335
(She can't get back up for a while.)

00:18:10.235 --> 00:18:15.215
(Those who were watching...)

00:18:17.015 --> 00:18:19.914
(are also taken aback by the unexpected situation.)

00:18:19.915 --> 00:18:21.055
Why?

00:18:21.555 --> 00:18:22.955
What do we do?

00:18:22.985 --> 00:18:25.925
(Sae Rok is standing rooted to the spot.)

00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:29.795
(Uie can't bring herself to watch it.)

00:18:32.295 --> 00:18:33.395
What do we do?

00:18:33.965 --> 00:18:35.445
- No. I shouldn't cry. - This is bad.

00:18:36.135 --> 00:18:38.265
She's worn out. She must be exhausted.

00:18:39.365 --> 00:18:41.104
She was really exhausted,

00:18:41.105 --> 00:18:42.945
but she just hung in there with her willpower.

00:18:43.075 --> 00:18:44.204
After it was over...

00:18:44.205 --> 00:18:45.304
(She held out with all her might for 1 minute and 30 seconds.)

00:18:45.305 --> 00:18:47.275
She was drained of energy, and her legs gave out.

00:18:48.845 --> 00:18:52.715
(The medical team goes in to check her condition.)

00:18:54.215 --> 00:18:55.984
(She tries to get up, )

00:18:55.985 --> 00:18:58.325
(but her body isn't working the way she wants.)

00:18:59.355 --> 00:19:01.925
(She keeps breathing hard.)

00:19:02.625 --> 00:19:03.655
Take a deep breath.

00:19:03.765 --> 00:19:04.995
Do you know where you are?

00:19:05.695 --> 00:19:07.065
- Breathe. - Where are you now?

00:19:08.465 --> 00:19:09.895
- Where are we? - A stadium.

00:19:09.995 --> 00:19:11.065
- Stadium? - Stadium?

00:19:11.205 --> 00:19:13.135
- Breathe slowly. - How is she?

00:19:13.905 --> 00:19:15.945
It's all right. You just need to catch your breath.

00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:18.904
Is there any part that feels weak? Move your fingertips.

00:19:18.905 --> 00:19:21.075
- I can't move my legs. - You can't move your legs?

00:19:22.215 --> 00:19:24.285
Are you okay, In Ah? Can you hear me?

00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:25.845
Keep breathing..

00:19:26.085 --> 00:19:28.855
It's all right. Keep breathing.. You'll be fine.

00:19:29.685 --> 00:19:31.384
No. In Ah will get over this.

00:19:31.385 --> 00:19:33.455
(The members are watching it anxiously.)

00:19:34.795 --> 00:19:36.394
She held out with her willpower.

00:19:36.395 --> 00:19:38.165
(They try hard to hold back tears.)

00:19:38.365 --> 00:19:39.465
In Ah will be fine.

00:19:40.065 --> 00:19:41.565
She gave it her all.

00:19:42.235 --> 00:19:43.265
Breathe.

00:19:44.365 --> 00:19:46.004
(In Ah got her breath back a little.)

00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:48.275
Try to raise your head and sit up slowly.

00:19:48.535 --> 00:19:51.975
(She sits up with the help of the medical team.)

00:19:52.305 --> 00:19:53.805
You did well.

00:19:54.015 --> 00:19:55.675
- You're all right. - Is it over?

00:19:55.775 --> 00:19:57.185
Yes, it's over. Get up.

00:20:00.215 --> 00:20:01.315
Slowly.

00:20:01.455 --> 00:20:03.485
- It's okay. - You did well.

00:20:03.755 --> 00:20:05.955
I have no strength in my body.

00:20:08.795 --> 00:20:10.525
- Keep breathing. - Breathe.

00:20:10.865 --> 00:20:13.024
Take a deep breath slowly.

00:20:13.025 --> 00:20:14.111
(After she leans against the corner)

00:20:14.135 --> 00:20:16.095
- Is it over? - Yes. It's over.

00:20:17.265 --> 00:20:18.635
- It's okay. - Sit up straight.

00:20:18.705 --> 00:20:20.265
- It's okay. - Keep your back straight.

00:20:20.605 --> 00:20:23.204
- Breathe. Take a deep breath. - You did well.

00:20:23.205 --> 00:20:24.675
(She bursts into tears.)

00:20:25.175 --> 00:20:26.735
Raise your head and breathe. It's okay.

00:20:27.845 --> 00:20:29.045
Take a deep breath slowly.

00:20:31.115 --> 00:20:33.845
(As she has worked passionately, )

00:20:33.955 --> 00:20:35.114
You did a good job.

00:20:35.115 --> 00:20:38.124
(she is more disappointed.)

00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:39.185
You did well.

00:20:40.355 --> 00:20:42.595
You tried your best. I saw it all.

00:20:43.695 --> 00:20:45.265
- You worked hard. - Can you come down?

00:20:45.295 --> 00:20:46.325
Come on down.

00:20:47.495 --> 00:20:48.565
Try to go down.

00:20:48.635 --> 00:20:49.755
Be careful as you come down.

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:50.865
Move slowly.

00:20:50.866 --> 00:20:52.365
Please help her go down.

00:20:54.335 --> 00:20:58.305
(Leaving her regrets behind, In Ah descends the ring.)

00:20:59.205 --> 00:21:02.675
(The spectators give it up for her as they understand how she feels.)

00:21:02.715 --> 00:21:03.775
Move slowly.

00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:05.545
She needs to lie down.

00:21:06.185 --> 00:21:07.285
My goodness. Be careful.

00:21:07.685 --> 00:21:08.854
- Slowly. - Her left foot.

00:21:08.855 --> 00:21:10.785
(Her legs give out again as she goes back.)

00:21:10.985 --> 00:21:13.184
(In Ah goes to the waiting area with the support of the medical team.)

00:21:13.185 --> 00:21:14.425
Move slowly.

00:21:15.095 --> 00:21:16.154
No. Don't cry.

00:21:16.155 --> 00:21:17.515
(The members were watching In Ah.)

00:21:18.425 --> 00:21:19.665
Don't let it get you down.

00:21:20.165 --> 00:21:22.694
If you get disturbed here, In Ah will feel bad for you.

00:21:22.695 --> 00:21:23.695
Don't let it get to you.

00:21:23.696 --> 00:21:25.505
- Try your best and stay focused. - Okay.

00:21:25.565 --> 00:21:27.775
Anything can happen before your match.

00:21:28.405 --> 00:21:30.235
Let's just focus on our matches.

00:21:30.305 --> 00:21:31.705
She's right.

00:21:32.305 --> 00:21:34.775
(The matches continue.)

00:21:35.075 --> 00:21:36.914
- Is your vision blurry? - Vision...

00:21:36.915 --> 00:21:38.514
No. It is fine.

00:21:38.515 --> 00:21:39.584
You're just feeling weak.

00:21:39.585 --> 00:21:41.554
I said I'd use all my strength, so I did.

00:21:41.555 --> 00:21:42.984
Did she eat anything?

00:21:42.985 --> 00:21:44.884
- Yes, she had a meal. - She did?

00:21:44.885 --> 00:21:46.054
Her blood pressure is normal.

00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:47.224
(Her blood pressure is normal.)

00:21:47.225 --> 00:21:48.424
Don't overtax yourself.

00:21:48.425 --> 00:21:49.554
The members...

00:21:49.555 --> 00:21:50.625
(After getting some rest)

00:21:51.195 --> 00:21:52.824
- I have to go to the members. - Okay.

00:21:52.825 --> 00:21:54.034
- You can go later. Move slowly. - Careful.

00:21:54.035 --> 00:21:56.235
(She sits up slowly.)

00:21:57.135 --> 00:21:58.405
I'm fine, Mom.

00:21:59.105 --> 00:22:00.564
- I... - I know you worked so hard.

00:22:00.565 --> 00:22:03.235
(My daughter worked so hard.)

00:22:04.475 --> 00:22:05.675
You did a great job.

00:22:06.945 --> 00:22:08.614
I really worked hard.

00:22:08.615 --> 00:22:10.814
I know. I know that better than anyone.

00:22:10.815 --> 00:22:14.385
(I know that better than anyone.)

00:22:14.915 --> 00:22:19.085
(The words melt In Ah's upset heart.)

00:22:20.485 --> 00:22:22.794
I worked really hard.

00:22:22.795 --> 00:22:24.895
I know that. You really did.

00:22:26.825 --> 00:22:29.565
What Mom said...

00:22:30.135 --> 00:22:33.005
melted my heart despite all that.

00:22:34.135 --> 00:22:37.874
I was so grateful that she recognized my hard work.

00:22:37.875 --> 00:22:40.815
I felt like the past three months of my effort were being recognized.

00:22:41.745 --> 00:22:44.144
You tried really hard.

00:22:44.145 --> 00:22:45.285
You did a great job.

00:22:46.815 --> 00:22:48.155
Seriously...

00:22:49.885 --> 00:22:51.024
I'm fine.

00:22:51.025 --> 00:22:52.465
(After getting things off her chest)

00:22:53.525 --> 00:22:54.554
You should go.

00:22:54.555 --> 00:22:56.031
(In Ah forces herself to smile, feeling bad for her mom.)

00:22:56.055 --> 00:22:57.295
Did Ju Hyun's match begin?

00:22:57.495 --> 00:22:58.625
I don't know.

00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:00.165
I wasn't in my right mind.

00:23:00.465 --> 00:23:01.535
I should go.

00:23:01.765 --> 00:23:03.164
- No. Take your time. - You need to rest.

00:23:03.165 --> 00:23:04.534
- No. - Can you walk?

00:23:04.535 --> 00:23:06.775
- I have to go see Ju Hyun. - Let's see if you can walk.

00:23:06.865 --> 00:23:08.475
Just help me get up.

00:23:09.275 --> 00:23:11.044
- Compared to before... - Slowly.

00:23:11.045 --> 00:23:12.375
No. You can't move.

00:23:12.505 --> 00:23:13.505
Stay seated.

00:23:13.975 --> 00:23:15.375
My legs feel so weak now.

00:23:17.485 --> 00:23:18.714
Get some more rest.

00:23:18.715 --> 00:23:21.815
(She is still not 100 percent recovered.)

00:23:22.615 --> 00:23:23.855
Yes. You should lie down.

00:23:24.085 --> 00:23:25.155
I want to go.

00:23:26.455 --> 00:23:29.155
(But what's more important is to recover.)

00:23:29.595 --> 00:23:31.725
(She will get some rest and see how things go.)

00:23:33.195 --> 00:23:36.365
(The matches continue.)

00:23:37.705 --> 00:23:38.705
Go ahead.

00:23:38.706 --> 00:23:40.235
(Ju Hyun's match is coming up soon.)

00:23:40.305 --> 00:23:42.334
- I have my headgear. - Okay.

00:23:42.335 --> 00:23:43.875
I just need these.

00:23:45.575 --> 00:23:46.804
- I'm okay. - Are you all right?

00:23:46.805 --> 00:23:48.275
- You'll be fine. - I'm fine.

00:23:49.715 --> 00:23:51.915
(She puts her coach at his ease with a cheerful voice.)

00:23:52.685 --> 00:23:53.715
There you go.

00:23:53.815 --> 00:23:56.054
- Go, Ju Hyun! - Just focus on your match.

00:23:56.055 --> 00:23:59.255
(She tries to focus on her upcoming match.)

00:23:59.525 --> 00:24:01.695
(Moving to the waiting area)

00:24:02.395 --> 00:24:04.594
(She's fighting right after In Ah, so she should be nervous.)

00:24:04.595 --> 00:24:05.625
Ju Hyun.

00:24:05.895 --> 00:24:07.565
- Take it easy, okay? - Yes.

00:24:07.665 --> 00:24:08.894
- Stay calm. - Okay.

00:24:08.895 --> 00:24:09.964
It's no big deal.

00:24:09.965 --> 00:24:11.211
She will charge as soon as it begins.

00:24:11.235 --> 00:24:12.434
What will you do then?

00:24:12.435 --> 00:24:13.464
- Two, hook. - That's it.

00:24:13.465 --> 00:24:14.534
- One, two. - Right.

00:24:14.535 --> 00:24:16.611
- Then one, two, and withdraw. - Two, hook, withdraw.

00:24:16.635 --> 00:24:18.945
She will go to the left.

00:24:19.805 --> 00:24:23.345
(The opponent showed a fierce fight in the preliminary.)

00:24:23.475 --> 00:24:25.414
One, two, pivot.

00:24:25.415 --> 00:24:26.814
One, two, shuffle.

00:24:26.815 --> 00:24:27.984
Keep repeating it.

00:24:27.985 --> 00:24:29.284
If she keeps getting close...

00:24:29.285 --> 00:24:30.884
- and I feel like it's not working, - Okay.

00:24:30.885 --> 00:24:33.054
I'll find another way to break through.

00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:34.925
(I'll find another way to break through.)

00:24:35.825 --> 00:24:38.665
(Her eyes show her determination not to give in.)

00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:41.035
(Another big match is expected.)

00:24:41.435 --> 00:24:44.765

00:24:45.935 --> 00:24:48.405

- Go, Ju Hyun! - Let's go!

00:24:57.515 --> 00:24:59.345
(A strong supporter, her dad cheers her on.)

00:25:00.115 --> 00:25:02.655
(Recharging her fighter's spirit)

00:25:03.685 --> 00:25:06.425

00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:09.795
(All preparations are complete.)

00:25:10.725 --> 00:25:12.195
Try your best. You can do this.

00:25:12.495 --> 00:25:14.695
Just do your thing. Don't worry about it. Okay?

00:25:16.035 --> 00:25:17.904
Her arms are quite long.

00:25:17.905 --> 00:25:19.765
Push her into a corner. Okay?

00:25:20.135 --> 00:25:22.135
Finish it when she is cornered.

00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:24.135
Park Ju Hyun.

00:25:24.805 --> 00:25:26.705
Good. Let's do this.

00:25:27.405 --> 00:25:30.015
(I just need to fight as I prepared.)

00:25:30.315 --> 00:25:31.644
Go, Park Ju Hyun!

00:25:31.645 --> 00:25:35.014

Touch gloves.

00:25:46.225 --> 00:25:47.295
To your corners.

Good. Let's go.

00:25:56.575 --> 00:25:58.574
- Good. - Circle around.

00:25:58.575 --> 00:26:00.244
- That's it. - Well done circling away.

00:26:00.245 --> 00:26:01.314
- Keep circling around. - Again.

00:26:01.315 --> 00:26:02.514

00:26:19.325 --> 00:26:21.241
That's it. You have to fight after circling away.

Fight after circling away.

00:26:23.935 --> 00:26:25.434
(But the opponent doesn't stop.)

Get out of it.

00:26:57.565 --> 00:26:58.611
(The two boxers clinch after a constant onslaught.)

00:27:33.465 --> 00:27:34.975
(and it can result in a warning.)

00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:36.275
Box.

00:27:36.335 --> 00:27:37.434
Good. You're doing well.

00:27:37.435 --> 00:27:38.544
Like that. Circle around.

00:27:38.545 --> 00:27:39.545
Circle around.

00:27:39.675 --> 00:27:42.114

(She throws a jab as she withdraws.)

00:27:50.855 --> 00:27:53.185

00:27:55.095 --> 00:27:58.565
(Jab)

00:27:58.795 --> 00:28:00.425
Yes! That's it!

00:28:00.865 --> 00:28:01.965

(Round 1 ends with Ju Hyun's valid strike.)

00:28:27.525 --> 00:28:28.555

This is chaotic.

00:28:30.595 --> 00:28:31.595
- That was really tough. - Yes.

00:28:31.596 --> 00:28:33.025
It's not easy to circle around.

00:28:33.465 --> 00:28:35.141
In that case, you should raise your guard...

00:28:35.165 --> 00:28:37.095
and counterattack like this.

00:28:37.735 --> 00:28:39.035
She's no big deal, right?

00:28:39.265 --> 00:28:41.704
You are landing all your jabs as you circle around.

00:28:41.705 --> 00:28:43.535
You should do what you're good at. Okay?

00:28:43.575 --> 00:28:45.574
- You did a great job. - I should be quick with my timing.

00:28:45.575 --> 00:28:47.174
(Her punches are accurate, but timing is crucial.)

00:28:47.175 --> 00:28:48.515
You know what I mean, right?

00:28:48.745 --> 00:28:50.215
Here's what you need to do.

00:28:50.445 --> 00:28:51.944
Don't withdraw. Just circle around. Okay

00:28:51.945 --> 00:28:53.015
Punch as you pivot.

00:28:53.515 --> 00:28:55.684
Look straight at her. You're not tired yet.

00:28:55.685 --> 00:28:56.715
Open your eyes wide.

00:28:57.115 --> 00:28:58.385
Finish it when she's cornered.

00:28:59.055 --> 00:29:00.155
Don't let her get out.

00:29:00.525 --> 00:29:01.555
Use all your strength.

00:29:01.625 --> 00:29:03.825
She gets out because you take a breather.

00:29:03.995 --> 00:29:05.094
Understood?

00:29:05.095 --> 00:29:06.324
- Do you understand? - Yes.

00:29:06.325 --> 00:29:07.895
- Answer me. Okay? - Yes.

00:29:08.635 --> 00:29:09.635
Go.

00:37:20.755 --> 00:37:21.794
(She is becoming increasingly aggressive.)

00:37:21.795 --> 00:37:23.825
That's it. Nice.

00:37:23.895 --> 00:37:25.795
Nice. You're doing great.

00:37:26.925 --> 00:37:28.335
Uie, you're doing great!

00:37:29.235 --> 00:37:31.165
(Another cross counter)

00:37:31.905 --> 00:37:35.275
(Uie throws a straight punch, while Hyeon Hee throws a hook.)

00:37:38.875 --> 00:37:40.645
(Only 10 seconds remain.)

00:37:41.045 --> 00:37:43.445
(Hyeon Hee throws a hook, while Uie throws a one-two.)

00:37:48.415 --> 00:37:50.455
(Round 1 ends.)

00:37:51.385 --> 00:37:54.125
- You got this! - Uie, you got this.

00:37:54.485 --> 00:37:55.924
You did so great.

00:37:55.925 --> 00:37:57.555
- You won the first round. - Right.

00:37:57.855 --> 00:37:58.925
You did great.

00:37:59.165 --> 00:38:00.695
It's nothing, right? You did great.

00:38:01.565 --> 00:38:03.965
You did so great, but keep throwing jabs...

00:38:04.335 --> 00:38:06.565
and you have to hit her with a one-two and a hook.

00:38:06.835 --> 00:38:08.474
If you can throw a hook,

00:38:08.475 --> 00:38:10.375
- your punches will definitely land. - Got it.

00:38:10.605 --> 00:38:13.505
(Meanwhile, in the red corner)

00:38:14.145 --> 00:38:15.944
She has a long reach,

00:38:15.945 --> 00:38:17.614
so go low and attack with a one-two.

00:38:17.615 --> 00:38:20.245
Go low, not face-to-face.

00:38:20.685 --> 00:38:22.715
Throw a one-two and a hook.

00:38:23.155 --> 00:38:25.385
It's a one-two and then a hook.

00:38:26.485 --> 00:38:29.555
(Just one round away from the gold medal.)

00:38:29.895 --> 00:38:33.565
(She has to give it her all in 1 minute and 30 seconds.)

00:38:34.465 --> 00:38:35.534
Get ready.

00:38:35.535 --> 00:38:37.295
(Round 2 begins.)

00:38:38.705 --> 00:38:39.734
Fight.

00:38:39.735 --> 00:38:42.805
(Round 2, Under 54kg: Kim Hyeon Hee versus Uie)

00:38:43.935 --> 00:38:45.844
Circle around.

00:38:45.845 --> 00:38:48.325
(As soon as the round begins, Hyeon Hee attacks aggressively.)

00:38:48.645 --> 00:38:52.585
- Uie. - Uie.

00:38:56.815 --> 00:38:59.484
Circle around.

00:38:59.485 --> 00:39:01.485
(Uie's opponent throws a series of strikes again.)

00:39:02.325 --> 00:39:05.964
(The opponent's valid strike: 1)

00:39:05.965 --> 00:39:08.464
(The opponent's valid strike: 2)

00:39:08.465 --> 00:39:12.705
(The opponent's valid strike)

00:39:13.035 --> 00:39:14.935
She knows she fell behind in Round One.

00:39:16.835 --> 00:39:19.304
- Uie. - Uie.

00:39:19.305 --> 00:39:21.674
Kim Uie, you got this.

00:39:21.675 --> 00:39:24.445
- You got this! - Uie!

00:39:27.845 --> 00:39:29.515
(Uie's opponent throws a right hook.)

00:39:29.985 --> 00:39:31.855
Keep going. Quickly. That's it.

00:39:33.855 --> 00:39:36.525
(Uie throws a left hook.)

00:39:36.695 --> 00:39:38.965
(Her opponent momentarily loses balance and falls.)

00:39:39.925 --> 00:39:41.695
Keep going. Quickly. That's it.

00:39:43.095 --> 00:39:46.335
(The crowd goes wild at the intensity of the match.)

00:39:46.665 --> 00:39:49.505
She's so good.

00:39:49.805 --> 00:39:52.275
(The opponent gets back up on her feet.)

00:39:55.115 --> 00:39:56.115
You got this!

00:39:56.116 --> 00:39:57.675
(The match resumes.)

00:40:00.215 --> 00:40:03.915
(A slugfest begins.)

00:40:05.125 --> 00:40:07.525
Uie, don't forget the hook.

00:40:07.655 --> 00:40:09.625
- You got this! - Uie, you got this!

00:40:09.655 --> 00:40:11.095
- That's it. - You got this!

00:40:11.155 --> 00:40:12.865
- You got this! - Again!

00:40:16.965 --> 00:40:19.565
(Her opponent launches a flurry of punches.)

00:40:19.665 --> 00:40:20.835
Pivot and block.

00:40:21.165 --> 00:40:22.435
Pivot and move in.

00:40:27.445 --> 00:40:28.615
That's it.

00:40:28.775 --> 00:40:34.545
(Uie dodges the one-two and counters with a hook.)

00:40:34.615 --> 00:40:35.785
Again.

00:40:36.055 --> 00:40:37.614
That's it.

00:40:37.615 --> 00:40:39.855
- Okay. Nice. - That's it.

00:40:42.595 --> 00:40:45.595
(The two boxers attack until the very end.)

00:40:45.965 --> 00:40:46.994
Stop.

00:40:46.995 --> 00:40:48.535
(Round 2 ends.)

00:40:48.935 --> 00:40:49.995
You did well.

00:40:50.765 --> 00:40:53.565
(Uie's first match was intense.)

00:40:53.765 --> 00:40:56.575
(You are amazing, Uie!)

00:40:56.675 --> 00:40:58.005
I think she won.

00:40:59.045 --> 00:41:00.674
You did well, Uie!

00:41:00.675 --> 00:41:01.675
Okay.

00:41:01.676 --> 00:41:03.314

(Thank you!)

00:41:05.215 --> 00:41:07.684
(She cheerfully greets her team, who supported her.)

00:41:07.685 --> 00:41:08.714
She did so well.

00:41:08.715 --> 00:41:10.554
She finally looks comfortable, now that it's over.

00:41:10.555 --> 00:41:11.654
Yes, it's over. She did a good job.

00:41:11.655 --> 00:41:13.124
- Good job. - Good job.

00:41:13.125 --> 00:41:15.101
(Uie looks much brighter, now that her tension is eased.)

00:41:15.125 --> 00:41:19.365
(And now is the time for the judgement.)

00:41:20.695 --> 00:41:21.834
Uie did so well.

00:41:21.835 --> 00:41:24.095
(The most nerve-racking moment)

00:41:24.365 --> 00:41:26.805
(It is Uie's first debut match, )

00:41:27.205 --> 00:41:30.275
(and also the championships.)

00:41:33.975 --> 00:41:35.044
Please.

00:41:35.045 --> 00:41:36.345
(Please.)

00:41:36.715 --> 00:41:40.015
(The judges carefully tally the results.)

00:41:40.185 --> 00:41:44.415

00:41:44.785 --> 00:41:48.125
(She put in her everything into the 3 minutes.)

00:41:48.525 --> 00:41:52.195

(Uie's first win in a tournament)

00:42:26.676 --> 00:42:28.716
It was too strict. It was way too hard.

00:42:28.816 --> 00:42:30.516
Good job. You're the best.

00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:33.646

Uie.

00:42:41.686 --> 00:42:43.555

(She was so happy that she forgot about the medal.)

00:42:46.766 --> 00:42:50.496
(Guys, I got the gold medal!)

00:42:51.136 --> 00:42:53.965
(They know how genuine her efforts were, )

00:42:53.966 --> 00:42:55.776

00:43:12.086 --> 00:43:16.256
(The joy of having made another accomplishment)

00:43:17.156 --> 00:43:18.395
Uie.

00:43:18.396 --> 00:43:20.566
(And tears of joy)

00:43:20.726 --> 00:43:21.826
Good job.

00:43:23.596 --> 00:43:25.935
- We still have Sae Rok left. - Yes.

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:28.006
- Good job. - Let's cheer for Sae Rok.

I'll just do it.

00:43:56.196 --> 00:43:57.435
(The last one in line is the most nerve-racking turn.)

00:43:57.436 --> 00:43:58.565
I can do it.

00:43:58.566 --> 00:43:59.806
We can all do it.

00:44:03.036 --> 00:44:06.476
(Sae Rok gets ready for the match.)

00:44:06.546 --> 00:44:07.746

00:44:54.156 --> 00:44:55.185
Shake hands.

00:44:55.186 --> 00:44:56.696

(And connects it to a jab)

00:45:24.086 --> 00:45:25.156
Keep moving.

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:26.596
- Keep moving. - Let's go.

00:45:26.826 --> 00:45:27.826

00:46:03.296 --> 00:46:05.196
(Cross-counter)

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:07.795
(Sae Rok follows up with a long jab.)

00:46:07.796 --> 00:46:09.076
You need to reach until the end.

00:46:10.596 --> 00:46:12.065
(The opponent's jab...)

00:46:12.066 --> 00:46:14.806
(and a high-low combination)

00:46:18.636 --> 00:46:19.776
- That's it. - Hit.

00:46:19.906 --> 00:46:20.975
- Hit. - Let's go, Sae Rok.

00:46:20.976 --> 00:46:22.045
- That's it. - That's it.

00:46:22.046 --> 00:46:24.975
(A slugfest follows.)

00:46:24.976 --> 00:46:26.716
Again. Do that again.

00:46:26.916 --> 00:46:28.016
Let's go.

00:46:30.056 --> 00:46:31.585
(The opponent throws a right hook.)

00:46:31.586 --> 00:46:35.126
(And a jab)

00:46:40.066 --> 00:46:43.235
(The opponent doesn't stop and keeps driving in.)

00:46:43.236 --> 00:46:45.265
Just throw an uppercut.

00:46:45.266 --> 00:46:47.466
(The opponent throws a clean jab at her instantly.)

00:46:48.936 --> 00:46:50.035
Hey, look.

00:46:50.036 --> 00:46:52.006
(It's her last chance to attack in Round 1.)

00:46:54.246 --> 00:46:56.546
(Round 1 ends with Sae Rok's valid strike.)

00:46:59.016 --> 00:47:03.416
(40-second rest period)

00:47:03.986 --> 00:47:05.056
Breathe.

00:47:05.456 --> 00:47:06.556
Breathe.

00:47:07.386 --> 00:47:11.396
(Sae Rok breathes heavily.)

00:47:11.496 --> 00:47:13.525
She was losing a lot at first,

00:47:13.526 --> 00:47:15.965
but she didn't back down, and kept throwing punches.

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:20.466
So I think that's when the opponent's spark died out.

00:47:20.936 --> 00:47:23.076
I think the opponent will attack even more.

00:47:23.176 --> 00:47:24.735
I think she will keep coming in.

00:47:24.736 --> 00:47:25.746
(Worried)

00:47:26.206 --> 00:47:27.345
You did well.

00:47:27.346 --> 00:47:29.476
Keep your high-low combination just like you did.

00:47:30.346 --> 00:47:34.386
(Round 2 strategy: Dive in with the high-low combination.)

00:47:34.516 --> 00:47:36.885
The opponent keeps coming in low.

00:47:36.886 --> 00:47:37.956
Then what should you do?

00:47:38.256 --> 00:47:40.725
Cross-counter after the one, okay?

00:47:40.726 --> 00:47:42.225
Just cross-counter with the opponent.

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:43.395
(Round 2 strategy: Counterattack with the cross-counter.)

00:47:43.396 --> 00:47:44.496
Breathe.

00:47:44.726 --> 00:47:45.846
You're doing well right now.

00:47:48.026 --> 00:47:50.266
- Let's go, Hyun Sil! - Let's go, Hyun Sil!

00:47:50.696 --> 00:47:52.836
- Let's go, Sae Rok! - Let's go, Sae Rok!

00:47:53.236 --> 00:47:54.866
Show them, Sae Rok!

00:47:55.366 --> 00:47:58.536
(There is only one round left.)

00:48:02.876 --> 00:48:04.015
Round Two.

00:48:04.016 --> 00:48:05.276
(Round 2 begins.)

00:48:05.446 --> 00:48:06.515
This is the last round.

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:08.486
- Let's go, Sae Rok! - Let's go, Sae Rok!

00:48:08.516 --> 00:48:09.786
- Good luck. - Thank you.

00:48:12.016 --> 00:48:13.285
Keep going.

00:48:13.286 --> 00:48:14.426
Don't get scared.

00:48:14.756 --> 00:48:16.225
- That's it. - That's it.

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.425
- More! - Keep going!

00:48:17.426 --> 00:48:18.955
(She corners her opponent.)

00:48:18.956 --> 00:48:20.765
(And throws a flurry of punches.)

00:48:20.766 --> 00:48:22.196
- Good! That's it! - That's it!

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:23.465
- Yes, good. - That's it!

00:48:23.466 --> 00:48:24.765
(Two...)

00:48:24.766 --> 00:48:26.706
(and even a hook.)

00:48:28.036 --> 00:48:29.905
(Once more, two...)

00:48:29.906 --> 00:48:32.546
(and hook)

00:48:32.606 --> 00:48:34.776
Keep going!

00:48:35.546 --> 00:48:37.775
(The opponent counterattacks right away.)

00:48:37.776 --> 00:48:39.916
- More. - More.

00:48:40.616 --> 00:48:42.046
Throw it. Watch.

00:48:43.186 --> 00:48:44.316
Throw it. Keep moving.

00:48:45.716 --> 00:48:47.125
Keep moving.

00:48:47.126 --> 00:48:49.155
- Number 2. - Number 2.

00:48:49.156 --> 00:48:51.676
(After exchanging attacks, they keep in check for a long time.)

00:48:52.096 --> 00:48:53.196
Go in.

00:48:53.866 --> 00:48:54.896
Throw it.

00:48:56.636 --> 00:48:59.336
(A heavy right hook from the opponent)

00:49:00.366 --> 00:49:01.505
- That's it. - That's it.

00:49:01.506 --> 00:49:03.976
(Sae Rok counterattacks with a jab.)

00:49:04.536 --> 00:49:06.676
(Cross-counter)

00:49:09.176 --> 00:49:10.375
- You have to keep going. - That's it.

00:49:10.376 --> 00:49:11.516
(And another cross-counter)

00:49:11.716 --> 00:49:13.286
You have to reach out.

00:49:16.956 --> 00:49:18.115
Keep going, Sae Rok.

00:49:18.116 --> 00:49:23.426
(The opponent gets low and throws a jab.)

00:49:24.596 --> 00:49:26.766
(Sae Rok counterattacks with a jab, as well.)

00:49:26.996 --> 00:49:28.826
- Number 1. - Number 1.

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:30.635
- That's it. Go with number 1. - Number 1.

00:49:30.636 --> 00:49:33.156
(Sae Rok pushes forward after getting hit with a valid strike.)

00:49:33.806 --> 00:49:35.366
That's it. Follow her!

00:49:35.406 --> 00:49:36.776
One, two!

00:49:39.306 --> 00:49:43.116
(However, she missed her chance to attack.)

00:49:43.376 --> 00:49:45.216
Let's go for the last one.

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:48.086
Go for it. Get in there.

00:49:48.616 --> 00:49:51.555
- Hold on! - To the right.

00:49:51.556 --> 00:49:53.186
(The two get close near the end.)

00:49:53.786 --> 00:49:55.026
- Get in there. - Get in there.

00:49:56.556 --> 00:49:58.756
(Round 2 ends.)

00:49:58.956 --> 00:50:01.436
- I don't know about this round. - That was kind of ambiguous.

00:50:01.796 --> 00:50:04.136
(However, the die is cast.)

00:50:07.006 --> 00:50:08.306
I got hit too much.

00:50:09.536 --> 00:50:11.236
That was close, right?

00:50:13.046 --> 00:50:17.546
(Regretting as soon as the match ends)

00:50:18.216 --> 00:50:22.586
(The judges are combining the scores.)

00:50:22.956 --> 00:50:24.316
Please, sir.

00:50:25.116 --> 00:50:27.386
(Nervous)

00:50:28.126 --> 00:50:33.026
(Time to announce)

00:50:34.126 --> 00:50:39.136
(The past 3 months flash before her eyes.)

00:50:39.704 --> 00:50:42.004
(Nervous)

00:50:42.704 --> 00:50:47.604
(Time to announce)

00:50:48.674 --> 00:50:53.814
(The past 3 months flash before her eyes.)

00:50:56.714 --> 00:50:58.884
(Keum Sae Rok lost.)

00:51:01.154 --> 00:51:02.184
Bow.

00:51:03.124 --> 00:51:05.623
- Good job. - Good job. That was a good fight.

00:51:05.624 --> 00:51:07.524
(Applause to Sae Rok who did her best)

00:51:09.124 --> 00:51:11.764
- You did a great job. - Thank you.

00:51:11.894 --> 00:51:13.833
- Good job. - You were amazing.

00:51:13.834 --> 00:51:15.633
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:51:15.634 --> 00:51:17.373
- Thank you. Good job. - Good work.

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:19.374
- Thank you. I'm rooting for you. - Thank you.

00:51:21.644 --> 00:51:24.174
- Good job. - Good job.

00:51:24.344 --> 00:51:26.143
Silver medal goes to the Blue Corner.

00:51:26.144 --> 00:51:28.343
Keum Sae Rok from Iron Girls.

00:51:28.344 --> 00:51:29.453
(Silver medal to Keum Sae Rok from Iron Girls)

00:51:29.454 --> 00:51:30.554
It's the silver medal.

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:32.884
- Thank you. - Gold medal...

00:51:32.954 --> 00:51:34.723
- It's shining even more. - She deserves it.

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:37.323
- It shines even more. - Gold medal to the Red Corner.

00:51:37.324 --> 00:51:39.094
Yang Hyun Sil from Action School.

00:51:39.394 --> 00:51:40.694
Good fight.

00:51:41.194 --> 00:51:42.223
Thank you.

00:51:42.224 --> 00:51:44.793
(Bowing bravely to the end)

00:51:44.794 --> 00:51:46.634
- Thank you. Bye. - Bye.

00:51:47.464 --> 00:51:49.333
Good job. You did great.

00:51:49.334 --> 00:51:50.873
- Sorry. - No. You were amazing.

00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:51.934
Thank you.

00:51:52.174 --> 00:51:53.204
Gosh.

00:51:53.244 --> 00:51:54.574
It's okay.

00:51:55.074 --> 00:51:56.213
It's okay. Good job.

00:51:56.214 --> 00:51:57.214
(Although Sae Rok's sad, she still shows her smile.)

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:58.214
- It's okay. - Good job.

00:51:58.215 --> 00:52:00.883
Sorry. I'll be more enthusiastic next time.

00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:03.214
- Good job. - Why are you apologizing?

00:52:04.984 --> 00:52:07.623
Good job.

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:08.883
(Celebrating Sae Rok who did her best to the end)

00:52:08.884 --> 00:52:10.653
I love you.

00:52:10.654 --> 00:52:12.764
Good job.

00:52:13.264 --> 00:52:14.264
Thank you.

00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:16.233
The silver medal. Amazing.

00:52:16.234 --> 00:52:17.610
- May I have your attention, please? - Good job.

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:19.463
Still, I got the silver medal.

00:52:19.464 --> 00:52:21.163
- Of course. - Yes.

00:52:21.164 --> 00:52:23.703
- Hey. You still beat one. - I won.

00:52:23.704 --> 00:52:25.033
I did a good job.

00:52:25.034 --> 00:52:26.403
- That was amazing. - Good job.

00:52:26.404 --> 00:52:28.243
Let's go. Good job.

00:52:28.244 --> 00:52:29.520
(Iron Girls' first tournament ends.)

00:52:29.544 --> 00:52:30.674
Bokddeong.

00:52:31.614 --> 00:52:32.744
Bokddeong.

00:52:32.984 --> 00:52:34.243
Do you want to take a picture, Dad?

00:52:34.244 --> 00:52:35.714
- Since I got a medal? - Yes.

00:52:35.814 --> 00:52:37.754
Let's take a picture. One, two, three.

00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:40.924
(Taking a picture with the family who cheered them)

00:52:41.354 --> 00:52:43.824
What's going on? Why are there so many celebrities?

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:46.224
(The members of "Our Little Sister" rooted for her.)

00:52:46.824 --> 00:52:50.594
(Iron Girls spend time catching up after the first tournament.)

00:52:50.764 --> 00:52:52.634
- Let's take a picture together. - A picture?

00:52:53.234 --> 00:52:55.034
One, two, three.

00:52:55.904 --> 00:52:59.234
(Commemorating the win in the first tournament)

00:52:59.274 --> 00:53:01.473
- One, two... - Go. One, two, three.

00:53:01.474 --> 00:53:04.244
- Go, Iron Girls. - Go, Iron Girls.

00:53:04.974 --> 00:53:07.313
(After the first tournament)

00:53:07.314 --> 00:53:09.513
Finally, it's over.

00:53:09.514 --> 00:53:10.913
Good job.

00:53:10.914 --> 00:53:12.254
Gosh.

00:53:12.654 --> 00:53:15.524
- Yes. - The first tournament is over.

00:53:15.684 --> 00:53:17.423
- Good job. - Good job.

00:53:17.424 --> 00:53:19.594
It was so much pressure.

00:53:19.694 --> 00:53:21.463
- It's finally over. - You did a great job.

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:23.563
Good job. You were amazing.

00:53:23.564 --> 00:53:25.264
- Coach. - Good job.

00:53:25.764 --> 00:53:28.264
Anyway, In Ah...

00:53:29.004 --> 00:53:31.574
- She endured the game. - She endured it.

00:53:31.774 --> 00:53:33.244
But when the match was over,

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:35.704
her legs gave out,

00:53:36.474 --> 00:53:37.844
and she passed out.

00:53:38.814 --> 00:53:40.613
She's recovered.

00:53:40.614 --> 00:53:42.683
But still, to protect her,

00:53:42.684 --> 00:53:44.983
- the tournament isn't over. - We have another training.

00:53:44.984 --> 00:53:47.253
So it's best for her to rest.

00:53:47.254 --> 00:53:49.300
(She was sent to the hospital for a more detailed checkup.)

00:53:49.324 --> 00:53:52.454
It would've been nice if she were smiling here with us.

00:53:52.524 --> 00:53:55.393
She was supposed to receive a medal...

00:53:55.394 --> 00:53:57.193
on the ring after the match.

00:53:57.194 --> 00:53:58.733
It was the only one that didn't happen.

00:53:58.734 --> 00:53:59.904
- Right. - That's right.

00:54:00.034 --> 00:54:01.434
What's happening to her medal?

00:54:01.764 --> 00:54:03.034
- What? - What?

- In Ah. - The silver medal.

00:54:16.184 --> 00:54:18.414
You endured it to the end and got it.

00:54:18.554 --> 00:54:21.524
Her opponent was a boxer from Vietnam.

00:54:21.724 --> 00:54:23.593
She lost, but she fought well.

00:54:23.594 --> 00:54:24.623
- She lost, but she fought well. - It was very close.

00:54:24.624 --> 00:54:26.164
- Yes. - Right.

00:54:26.224 --> 00:54:28.294
Their 1st tournament just after 3 months.

00:54:28.494 --> 00:54:30.264
They trained only for three months.

00:54:30.434 --> 00:54:32.734
Two gold and two silver.

00:54:32.934 --> 00:54:34.233
Everyone got a medal.

00:54:34.234 --> 00:54:35.603
(2 gold medals, 2 silver medals)

Good job.

00:54:42.474 --> 00:54:44.774

00:54:48.344 --> 00:54:49.913
Hey, this is a miracle.

00:54:49.914 --> 00:54:51.954
- It's a miracle. - Can you believe it?

00:54:52.614 --> 00:54:56.823
(From a novice boxer...)

00:54:56.824 --> 00:55:00.524
(who was even scared to hit and get hit, )

00:55:01.594 --> 00:55:03.263
(she bravely overcame...)

00:55:03.264 --> 00:55:06.834
(various fears...)

00:55:07.264 --> 00:55:12.304
(and won the gold medal.)

00:55:16.514 --> 00:55:17.813

- Congratulations. - Gwang Bok. Congratulations.

00:55:20.584 --> 00:55:22.784
- That's wonderful. - Wait. Is this your second win?

00:55:22.954 --> 00:55:24.013
- What? - Amazing.

00:55:24.014 --> 00:55:25.754
Two wins out of two games.

00:55:26.114 --> 00:55:27.154
No loss.

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:29.723
- One hundred percent winning rate. - One hundred percent winning rate.

00:55:29.724 --> 00:55:31.223

(When she got punched for the first time, )

00:55:35.094 --> 00:55:39.834
(she kneeled down on the ring.)

00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:45.404
(The teary boxer who couldn't even watch her colleague's game...)

00:55:46.404 --> 00:55:52.144
(grew up to be a dogged mad boxer.)

00:55:52.414 --> 00:55:54.044
Yes! You got it!

00:55:54.444 --> 00:56:00.123
(That's how Ju Hyun became the champion.)

00:56:00.124 --> 00:56:01.423
Congratulations.

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:03.504
- Congratulations on the gold medal. - It's amazing.

00:56:03.794 --> 00:56:07.263
All the matches were very intense.

00:56:07.264 --> 00:56:08.363
They were dynamic.

00:56:08.364 --> 00:56:10.363
You gave your all.

00:56:10.364 --> 00:56:12.594
I like the story.

00:56:13.134 --> 00:56:15.033
The main game is next month.

00:56:15.034 --> 00:56:16.034
- Yes. - That's right.

00:56:16.035 --> 00:56:17.933
Let's give your all to the last one month.

00:56:17.934 --> 00:56:21.003
One of the things I always have on my mind is...

00:56:21.004 --> 00:56:23.714
if you don't enjoy your win and just regret it,

00:56:24.014 --> 00:56:26.314
you're not motivated in the next game.

00:56:26.684 --> 00:56:28.614
So we should all celebrate together...

00:56:28.784 --> 00:56:31.283
and cheer up with joy.

00:56:31.284 --> 00:56:33.523
- That's right. - Let's wrap up here.

00:56:33.524 --> 00:56:35.483
- You won. - Let's shout victory.

00:56:35.484 --> 00:56:37.053
- Let's cheer up. - Yes!

00:56:37.054 --> 00:56:39.253
- Yes. - Let's send applause to each other.

00:56:39.254 --> 00:56:40.793

- Thank you. - I won.

00:56:53.774 --> 00:56:56.673
Good job, everyone. I love you.

00:56:56.674 --> 00:56:58.714
(Iron Girls' first tournament ends.)

00:56:59.844 --> 00:57:02.984
(After the intense first tournament...)

00:57:03.414 --> 00:57:06.084
(The next day)

00:57:07.354 --> 00:57:08.924
My neck hurts.

00:57:10.554 --> 00:57:12.724
It's a sign that you got hit a lot.

00:57:13.524 --> 00:57:15.524
- She was strong. - I was scared.

00:57:15.794 --> 00:57:16.834
I was like...

00:57:17.764 --> 00:57:19.244
You were discouraged by her charisma.

00:57:19.604 --> 00:57:20.604
You were discouraged.

00:57:20.605 --> 00:57:22.103
How am I supposed to overcome it?

00:57:22.104 --> 00:57:24.403
- That is... - There's so much to do in boxing.

00:57:24.404 --> 00:57:26.744
Use more punches.

00:57:27.904 --> 00:57:31.314
(They still have a long way to go.)

00:57:32.544 --> 00:57:35.544
(Silver Sae Rok who won the silver medal...)

00:57:36.384 --> 00:57:39.384
(is training to become Gold Sae Rok.)

Right on the next day after the tournament.

00:57:46.624 --> 00:57:47.823
I can't even speak.

00:57:47.824 --> 00:57:50.534
(Pulling off so much training where she can't even speak)

00:57:50.664 --> 00:57:52.834
(However)

00:57:52.934 --> 00:57:55.133
(Sae Rok's training log: I guess I'm finally relaxed.)

00:57:55.134 --> 00:57:57.373
(I'm so sick. I got a severe fever after the tournament.)

00:57:57.374 --> 00:58:00.203
(This time, it's pretty severe. I have a drama shoot tomorrow.)

(Sae Rok's body aches severely on top of her busy schedule.)

00:58:08.044 --> 00:58:11.854
(Iron Girls have been recording their personal training.)

00:58:12.484 --> 00:58:14.323
(May, June, July)

00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:16.924
(Sae Rok's training log was full of training.)

00:58:18.394 --> 00:58:21.764
(However, she couldn't train for a week.)

00:58:22.524 --> 00:58:26.263

(Panting)

Harder.

(She can't keep her guard up.)

00:58:43.084 --> 00:58:46.624
(She can't possibly do her footwork.)

00:58:47.154 --> 00:58:49.023
(Her stamina dropped so much in a week.)

00:58:49.024 --> 00:58:50.394
You can't show your back.

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:52.354
Push him. That's right.

00:58:53.164 --> 00:58:54.263
(Sae Rok's training log:)

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:56.593
(I was anxious about losing my stamina after resting for too long.)

Before going boxing, for carbohydrates,

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:38.064
I'm going to have salad pasta. Then, I'm heading to the gym.

With just a little, it tastes and smells amazing.

01:02:23.534 --> 01:02:25.474
(There's no time left.)

01:02:26.574 --> 01:02:27.873
(Making an effort to give their all and to leave no regrets)

01:02:27.874 --> 01:02:29.003
Harder.

01:02:29.004 --> 01:02:30.274
- We can do it. - We can do it.

01:02:31.374 --> 01:02:32.513
(However, )

01:02:32.514 --> 01:02:35.744
(someone's missing.)

01:02:36.284 --> 01:02:37.553
Focus.

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:38.683
(Sae Rok's training log:)

01:02:38.684 --> 01:02:39.713
(I was excited to exercise with Uie and Ju Hyun.)

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:40.884
(I miss In Ah.)

01:02:41.484 --> 01:02:43.023
(Ju Hyun's training log: Training with Rocky and Uie.)

01:02:43.024 --> 01:02:44.293
(I missed In Ah, )

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:46.554
(but we braced ourselves and trained hard.)

01:02:46.994 --> 01:02:50.694
(Where is In Ah?)

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:53.463
(The first tournament is over, and in 2 weeks...)

01:02:53.464 --> 01:02:54.704
Hello.

01:02:54.834 --> 01:02:55.903
(Producer, writer)

01:02:55.904 --> 01:02:57.433
(The members of Iron Girls gather 1 by 1.)

01:02:57.434 --> 01:03:00.104
Long time no see. I missed you so much.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:02.473
(Gwang Bok appears.)

01:03:02.474 --> 01:03:04.014
- Hello. - Hello.

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:06.884
- The testosterone queen. - The testosterone queen.

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:08.614
Gosh, I'm hungry.

01:03:10.284 --> 01:03:11.314
As soon as you arrive?

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:12.884
Have you all been well?

01:03:13.584 --> 01:03:15.023
- I missed you. - I've been well, of course.

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:16.360
(Gathering for the first time since the first tournament)

01:03:16.384 --> 01:03:18.293
- You know my dad was there. - Yes.

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:21.264
He couldn't talk for a week after he returned to Busan.

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:23.693
He must've wanted to tell everyone.

01:03:23.694 --> 01:03:24.793
- No. - He lost his voice.

01:03:24.794 --> 01:03:26.263
He lost his voice.

01:03:26.264 --> 01:03:27.463
From cheering?

01:03:27.464 --> 01:03:29.063
- His voice was completely gone. - Really?

01:03:29.064 --> 01:03:30.374
He couldn't say a word.

01:03:30.434 --> 01:03:31.633
"Get me food."

01:03:31.634 --> 01:03:32.973
- Oh, my gosh. - That's how he was talking.

01:03:32.974 --> 01:03:34.403
So he went to the hospital for a week.

01:03:34.404 --> 01:03:37.813
- He rooted for us so much. - Yes.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.543
"Go, Keum Sae Rok!"

01:03:39.544 --> 01:03:41.243
(Ju Hyun's father rooted for them as loud as he could.)

01:03:41.244 --> 01:03:42.643
My mom was like,

01:03:42.644 --> 01:03:45.654
"What did your dad do there?"

01:03:46.654 --> 01:03:47.654
(Her mother, who had no idea what was going on, was completely lost.)

01:03:47.655 --> 01:03:49.624
"Why can't he speak?"

01:03:52.124 --> 01:03:53.253
(Everyone welcomes someone.)

01:03:53.254 --> 01:03:54.463
- Hello. - Hello.

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:55.493
Welcome back.

01:03:55.494 --> 01:03:56.934
You look so pretty today.

01:03:57.034 --> 01:03:58.334
Hello.

01:03:58.594 --> 01:03:59.693
You look so much better.

01:03:59.694 --> 01:04:02.263
- Your hair grew so much. - It got so long.

01:04:02.264 --> 01:04:04.064
(Iron Girls, including In Ah, have gathered.)

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:06.073
- You look calm and... - I know.

01:04:06.074 --> 01:04:07.573
You look like a newlywed bride.

01:04:07.574 --> 01:04:09.304
She's wearing all black.

01:04:09.374 --> 01:04:10.914
You look calm.

01:04:11.074 --> 01:04:12.614
Have you all been well?

01:04:13.014 --> 01:04:16.243
We haven't been well.

01:04:16.244 --> 01:04:17.713
Right. It's the aftereffect of the tournament.

01:04:17.714 --> 01:04:18.813
After the tournament,

01:04:18.814 --> 01:04:20.823
- she got sick. - Right.

01:04:20.824 --> 01:04:24.324
Because it was our first tournament,

01:04:24.454 --> 01:04:26.293
we were all very nervous.

01:04:26.294 --> 01:04:28.764
- There was an aftereffect. - We were too concerned about it.

01:04:29.294 --> 01:04:30.364
Right.

01:04:30.464 --> 01:04:32.664
Anyway,

01:04:33.834 --> 01:04:35.403
how are you feeling, In Ah?

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.464
I...

01:04:36.804 --> 01:04:38.933
- Hey. - This is important.

01:04:38.934 --> 01:04:40.773
No one could ask her.

01:04:40.774 --> 01:04:43.003
To be honest, we're trying to read your face.

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:45.874
Because we don't know about your condition.

01:04:47.144 --> 01:04:51.184
(The final of In Ah's first tournament)

01:04:52.884 --> 01:04:59.124
(She made a scary last-minute spurt.)

01:04:59.824 --> 01:05:04.194
(Since it was the final, she gave her all.)

01:05:06.764 --> 01:05:10.934
(In the end, she was exhausted...)

01:05:11.834 --> 01:05:16.143
(and passed out on the ring.)

01:05:16.144 --> 01:05:18.574
None of us knows how that feels.

01:05:18.674 --> 01:05:20.113
"Is In Ah exhausted?"

01:05:20.114 --> 01:05:21.543
"Did she give her all?" That's what we thought...

01:05:21.544 --> 01:05:23.083
- when we joined the tournament. - True.

01:05:23.084 --> 01:05:24.583
- After the tournament, - That's what I thought too.

01:05:24.584 --> 01:05:26.313
We even took a picture for winning the medal.

01:05:26.314 --> 01:05:27.524
Then...

01:05:28.354 --> 01:05:31.654
- You couldn't miss a picture. - you told us after the tournament.

01:05:31.954 --> 01:05:34.393
I was so confused.

01:05:34.394 --> 01:05:36.094
No wonder you were confused.

01:05:36.894 --> 01:05:38.734
I didn't want to make you worry,

01:05:38.794 --> 01:05:39.794
so I kept it a secret...

01:05:39.795 --> 01:05:42.104
- on the day of the tournament. - Right.

01:05:42.404 --> 01:05:47.574
Because I was worried about affecting the tournament.

01:05:47.874 --> 01:05:49.703
Be careful when you come down.

01:05:49.704 --> 01:05:50.773
Slowly.

01:05:50.774 --> 01:05:52.243
Can someone help her on the floor?

01:05:52.244 --> 01:05:53.783
(After she gave her all...)

01:05:53.784 --> 01:05:57.554
(and got off the ring...)

01:05:59.754 --> 01:06:01.023
Don't push yourself too much.

01:06:01.024 --> 01:06:03.154
(Even when she was completely exhausted, )

01:06:03.794 --> 01:06:04.993
I have to go see the girls.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:06.393
(all In Ah thought about was the members.)

01:06:06.394 --> 01:06:08.063
- Compared to before... - Slowly.

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:10.263
(She wanted to go back to the stadium, )

01:06:10.264 --> 01:06:12.263
- Don't push yourself. - Let me put this on.

01:06:12.264 --> 01:06:14.863
(but she couldn't move her legs.)

01:06:14.864 --> 01:06:17.104
My legs feel so weak now.

01:06:17.404 --> 01:06:18.733
Lie down slowly.

01:06:18.734 --> 01:06:20.574
Lie down slowly. Don't worry.

01:06:21.004 --> 01:06:22.274
Okay. One second.

01:06:22.474 --> 01:06:23.474
It's okay.

01:06:23.475 --> 01:06:24.813
- It hurts so much. - Where does it hurt?

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:26.244
My right side back.

01:06:26.544 --> 01:06:28.013
It hurts.

01:06:28.014 --> 01:06:30.513
(Due to the increasing pain, she was sent to the hospital in the end.)

01:06:30.514 --> 01:06:31.554
Hold on.

01:06:31.914 --> 01:06:34.253
(In Ah didn't tell the others...)

01:06:34.254 --> 01:06:35.753
- It hurts so much. - We're on it. Don't worry.

01:06:35.754 --> 01:06:38.154
(in case they'd be worried before the tournament.)

01:06:38.854 --> 01:06:41.723
(So they didn't know about her condition...)

01:06:41.724 --> 01:06:43.963
(on the day of the tournament.)

01:06:43.964 --> 01:06:47.033
It felt like I had no energy.

01:06:47.034 --> 01:06:49.463
It felt like I ran out of all my energy.

01:06:49.464 --> 01:06:50.673
"Wait. Why can't I move my legs?"

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.334
("Wait. Why can't I move my legs?")

01:06:52.534 --> 01:06:54.973
On the day of the tournament, I thought I couldn't move them...

01:06:54.974 --> 01:06:57.644
because I was exhausted and used up all my energy.

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:02.913
But I couldn't move one leg as I wanted.

01:07:02.914 --> 01:07:04.990
(The pain that was expected to be temporary continued.)

01:07:05.014 --> 01:07:07.553
(A treatment was necessary, )

01:07:07.554 --> 01:07:11.224
(so she was hospitalized immediately.)

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:14.394
I can't feel if I'm holding back.

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:18.263
Do it. Press your foot.

01:07:18.264 --> 01:07:21.464
(She couldn't strain her leg.)

01:07:21.764 --> 01:07:22.803
The other way.

01:07:22.804 --> 01:07:25.533
I did rehabilitation exercises for 1, 2, and 3 days.

01:07:25.534 --> 01:07:28.974
Rehab therapy, physiotherapy, and even injections.

01:07:29.204 --> 01:07:32.513
As I gained muscles and was recovering,

01:07:32.514 --> 01:07:34.984
my ankle didn't move as I wanted.

01:07:35.614 --> 01:07:37.114
I couldn't strain it.

01:07:37.684 --> 01:07:40.454
My ankles weren't getting better.

01:07:41.024 --> 01:07:42.653
Even I felt...

01:07:42.654 --> 01:07:47.294
my ankle wasn't in the condition to box.

01:07:48.524 --> 01:07:50.233
So even though I love boxing so much,

01:07:50.234 --> 01:07:53.363
I knew I couldn't compete in the tournament in August...

01:07:53.364 --> 01:07:56.633
because of my ankles.

01:07:56.634 --> 01:07:58.373
(I knew I couldn't compete in the tournament in August.)

01:07:58.374 --> 01:07:59.674
That's what I was thinking.

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:03.203
I'd given up in my heart.

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:05.674
(I'd given up in my heart.)

01:08:05.944 --> 01:08:07.683
You were probably startled the most.

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:11.614
You probably struggled the most mentally.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:14.323
As you know, I enjoyed boxing so much.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:18.723
I was sad to think I had to give up.

01:08:18.724 --> 01:08:20.424
(It wasn't easy to give up.)

01:08:21.164 --> 01:08:23.024
I blamed my injury so much.

01:08:23.494 --> 01:08:25.694
I didn't want to stop there.

01:08:26.934 --> 01:08:27.964
It felt like...

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.333
I was locked in a cage.

01:08:30.334 --> 01:08:32.333
Like this.

01:08:32.334 --> 01:08:33.374
"No more."

01:08:34.504 --> 01:08:36.473
- That's how much I loved boxing. - More!

01:08:36.474 --> 01:08:38.373
I don't know how I lived without boxing.

01:08:38.374 --> 01:08:40.484
That's how fun it was.

01:08:41.614 --> 01:08:42.913
The joy of reading the moves ahead...

01:08:42.914 --> 01:08:44.514
and successfully landing a valid strike.

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:47.323
"That's how you'll move, right? I'll dodge it and counterattack."

01:08:47.324 --> 01:08:49.084
And then landing that strike. The joy of it.

01:08:49.154 --> 01:08:50.724
Nice. That's it.

01:08:51.424 --> 01:08:52.453
Well done.

01:08:52.454 --> 01:08:54.793
That feeling was strangely satisfying.

01:08:54.794 --> 01:08:57.134
(That feeling was strangely satisfying.)

01:08:59.164 --> 01:09:00.264
Thank you.

01:09:00.934 --> 01:09:02.463
- Very close. - That was awesome.

01:09:02.464 --> 01:09:03.784
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

01:09:06.834 --> 01:09:07.874
I...

01:09:08.874 --> 01:09:10.543
boxed like a mad person.

01:09:10.544 --> 01:09:11.650
(In Ah kept going with all her might.)

01:09:11.674 --> 01:09:13.613
- It's over, right? - Breathe. Yes, it's over.

01:09:13.614 --> 01:09:14.883
(That's why the last tournament was disappointing for her.)

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:16.290
- You did well. - Straighten your back.

01:09:16.314 --> 01:09:17.860
- It's okay. - Straighten your back slowly.

01:09:17.884 --> 01:09:19.213
- Breathe. - You did well.

01:09:19.214 --> 01:09:20.724
- Deep breaths. - Well done.

01:09:22.724 --> 01:09:24.364
Lift your head up and breathe. It's okay.

01:09:25.454 --> 01:09:26.553
Breathe in and out slowly.

01:09:26.554 --> 01:09:31.134
(The tears she shed back then are unforgettable.)

01:09:31.494 --> 01:09:32.634
You did well.

01:09:35.134 --> 01:09:38.473
(And the trustworthy, reliable members...)

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:43.003
(who were there with her)

01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:44.074
That's why...

01:09:45.614 --> 01:09:48.944
I wondered why I still felt unhappy even after I'd already given up,

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.984
and why I kept having conversations with myself.

01:09:53.614 --> 01:09:56.854
The reason was that I'd given up too quickly.

01:09:56.924 --> 01:09:59.524
It was far too soon to quit.

01:10:00.664 --> 01:10:03.323
(Questioning whether she had given up too quickly, )

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:06.464
(In Ah pondered deeply.)

01:10:07.064 --> 01:10:10.774
My ankles have recovered about 80 percent.

01:10:12.404 --> 01:10:14.604
But honestly, with my ankles mostly healed...

01:10:16.104 --> 01:10:17.614
and my determination,

01:10:18.774 --> 01:10:20.274
I want everyone...

01:10:21.814 --> 01:10:24.313
to cheer me on until the end...

01:10:24.314 --> 01:10:26.614
as I pursue the goals...

01:10:26.684 --> 01:10:29.584
the Iron Girls have aimed for...

01:10:31.094 --> 01:10:33.323
from the very start.

01:10:33.324 --> 01:10:34.764
I want...

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.064
to train...

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:39.093
as much as possible until the very end.

01:10:39.094 --> 01:10:41.464
(I want to continue the challenge.)

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:43.603
I want to do as much as I can...

01:10:43.604 --> 01:10:45.373
without overstraining myself.

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:46.374
You're amazing.

01:10:46.604 --> 01:10:50.203
But that doesn't mean I'll go full-on out of greed.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:54.383
Even if I have to withdraw on the day of the tournament,

01:10:54.384 --> 01:10:56.483
I simply want to show my passion...

01:10:56.484 --> 01:10:58.883
by preparing until the very last moment.

01:10:58.884 --> 01:11:02.354
If I were in In Ah's shoes, I'd make the same decision.

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:04.693
That's why we understand you.

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:07.624
- True. - We knew you'd make this choice.

01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:11.093
But I want to add a word of advice.

01:11:11.094 --> 01:11:12.664
- Yes. - Don't overdo it.

01:11:13.294 --> 01:11:15.764
I don't want anyone getting hurt again.

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:18.003
It'd be great...

01:11:18.004 --> 01:11:20.074
if you could have fun...

01:11:20.904 --> 01:11:23.974
while staying as careful as possible.

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:26.913
In Ah is truly strong.

01:11:26.914 --> 01:11:29.013
- Totally, and it's cool. - I wouldn't...

01:11:29.014 --> 01:11:30.460
- She has incredible willpower. - True.

01:11:30.484 --> 01:11:32.183
- I have a gift. - What is it?

01:11:32.184 --> 01:11:34.424
It's for In Ah.

01:11:36.554 --> 01:11:38.094
Are you trying to move me?

01:11:39.024 --> 01:11:40.094
Oh, my.

01:11:40.464 --> 01:11:43.323
- Oh, my. - Right.

01:11:43.324 --> 01:11:44.494
Right.

01:11:44.664 --> 01:11:47.033
(Passing on In Ah's silver medal)

01:11:47.034 --> 01:11:48.333
Thank you.

01:11:48.334 --> 01:11:50.974
- It's a priceless medal. - For real.

01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:53.173
(She finally gets to touch the medal.)

01:11:53.174 --> 01:11:54.404
It's a treasure.

01:11:55.074 --> 01:11:57.773
I both love it and hate it at the same time.

01:11:57.774 --> 01:11:58.974
My feelings are all mixed up.

01:11:59.144 --> 01:12:00.243
Did everyone get theirs?

01:12:00.244 --> 01:12:01.344
- Yes. - Yes.

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:03.724
- I'll take it with me. - Okay.

01:12:04.154 --> 01:12:05.984
The front of the medal is quite pretty.

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:07.524
We received it in the ring.

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:09.644
You should too, in the upcoming tournament.

01:12:09.784 --> 01:12:11.753
- You get it, right? - I hope I can make it to the ring.

01:12:11.754 --> 01:12:13.153
If only the referee could put it on her.

01:12:13.154 --> 01:12:15.164
I'll do my best until the very end.

01:12:15.794 --> 01:12:17.263
Honestly, it feels amazing.

01:12:17.264 --> 01:12:18.964
- Having your arm raised. - Right?

01:12:19.194 --> 01:12:20.903
I want to feel it one more time.

01:12:20.904 --> 01:12:22.104
You felt it twice, didn't you?

01:12:22.164 --> 01:12:23.833
Our goal should be to win the finals.

01:12:23.834 --> 01:12:25.804
Let's stay undefeated, Park Ju Hyun.

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:28.103
My heart races just thinking about the tournament.

01:12:28.104 --> 01:12:29.143
- Really? - Yes.

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:33.043
I didn't feel relieved after the first tournament.

01:12:33.044 --> 01:12:36.183
If anything, I thought, "This is really tough."

01:12:36.184 --> 01:12:40.553
"We've come this far for the August tournament."

01:12:40.554 --> 01:12:42.084
"It's only going to get tougher."

01:12:42.124 --> 01:12:44.493
- The draw matters a great deal, - I agree.

01:12:44.494 --> 01:12:46.324
And the opponent's style is also important.

01:12:46.354 --> 01:12:48.994
Some styles I can handle well,

01:12:49.464 --> 01:12:51.263
while others are more difficult.

01:12:51.264 --> 01:12:53.593
But that's something you only find out in the ring.

01:12:53.594 --> 01:12:54.633
That's totally true.

01:12:54.634 --> 01:12:59.904
The atmosphere of the venue can be really overwhelming.

01:13:00.134 --> 01:13:04.244
But since this is our second and final tournament,

01:13:04.374 --> 01:13:08.913
wouldn't we feel more confident...

01:13:08.914 --> 01:13:11.583
than nervous or anxious?

01:13:11.584 --> 01:13:12.654
True.

01:13:13.114 --> 01:13:15.384
Winning and losing are, of course, important.

01:13:15.984 --> 01:13:17.253
- But if we do our best... - Yes.

01:13:17.254 --> 01:13:18.353
(Regardless of the outcome, to end without regrets)

01:13:18.354 --> 01:13:19.393
Let's do this.

01:13:19.394 --> 01:13:20.864
Let's stay strong and do it again.

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:22.424
We can do it.

01:13:22.994 --> 01:13:24.463
- Let's go. - Let's go.

01:13:24.464 --> 01:13:26.133
- Let's go. - Let's do this.

01:13:26.134 --> 01:13:27.964
(Aiming for everyone to finish)

01:13:29.764 --> 01:13:32.174
Today is day one of my return.

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:34.604
- Shall we take baby steps, Coach? - Yes.

01:13:34.704 --> 01:13:36.244
I tried some moves alone.

01:13:36.504 --> 01:13:37.843
My ankle snaps.

01:13:37.844 --> 01:13:39.974
It doesn't have enough strength yet.

01:13:40.544 --> 01:13:41.644
The footwork...

01:13:42.814 --> 01:13:44.054
is doable.

01:13:44.814 --> 01:13:46.483
Since your ankles are weak,

01:13:46.484 --> 01:13:48.854
rely more on your waist and less on footwork.

01:13:49.454 --> 01:13:52.193
(In Ah's training log: Boxing is honestly frightening.)

01:13:52.194 --> 01:13:54.193
(Even the thought of it makes me swallow hard.)

01:13:54.194 --> 01:13:56.293
(But since I've decided to do it, )

01:13:56.294 --> 01:13:59.294
(I'll give my all in my role as one of the Iron Girls.)

01:14:00.094 --> 01:14:03.403
(Other days too, training focused more on the upper body)

01:14:03.404 --> 01:14:04.404
My ankles feel weak.

01:14:04.734 --> 01:14:07.104
(Her ankles are still weak.)

01:14:07.304 --> 01:14:09.904
My ankles won't move as I want, and it's frustrating.

01:14:10.974 --> 01:14:12.274
(Screaming)

01:14:13.414 --> 01:14:17.144
(In Ah's stamina, combined with her injury, is wearing her down.)

01:14:18.014 --> 01:14:20.623
(Unexpectedly, I had to rest 2 two weeks.)

01:14:20.624 --> 01:14:23.783
(I'm worried my stamina and skills won't recover as before.)

01:14:23.784 --> 01:14:26.794
(But this is my last chance. I'll be careful until the end.)

01:14:28.364 --> 01:14:33.534
(Despite not being in perfect condition, In Ah gives it her all.)

01:14:34.264 --> 01:14:38.634
(In Ah is steadily regaining her performance level.)

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:41.644
(10 days before the final tournament)

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.043
- Hi. - Hi.

01:14:44.044 --> 01:14:45.343
Hi.

01:14:45.344 --> 01:14:47.013
- Hi. - Hi.

01:14:47.014 --> 01:14:49.060
(The Iron Girls have arrived for the official training.)

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:52.113
Two wins in two matches. Undefeated.

01:14:52.114 --> 01:14:53.313
I'm jealous.

01:14:53.314 --> 01:14:56.154
(Undefeated boxer Gwang Bok)

01:14:56.354 --> 01:14:58.253
I'm Silver Sae Rok.

01:14:58.254 --> 01:15:00.094
(2 matches, 1 win, 1 loss)

01:15:00.254 --> 01:15:03.163
- Hi. - Hi.

01:15:03.164 --> 01:15:05.033
- Hi. - Hi.

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:06.293
- Are you okay? - It's been a while.

01:15:06.294 --> 01:15:07.663
- Hi. - Long time no see.

01:15:07.664 --> 01:15:09.033
- Hi. - Are you okay?

01:15:09.034 --> 01:15:10.633
Our final destination.

01:15:10.634 --> 01:15:12.374
- Right. - We have...

01:15:12.504 --> 01:15:14.804
ten days until the Incheon tournament.

01:15:14.944 --> 01:15:18.474
Today will be the final check.

01:15:18.844 --> 01:15:21.314
We went through so many tests on the first day.

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:27.214
Right? Do you remember the training you were all excited about?

01:15:27.424 --> 01:15:28.954
- Which one? - We did a lot that day.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:30.054
You did?

01:15:30.154 --> 01:15:31.154
(Curious)

01:15:31.155 --> 01:15:32.194
What can it be?

01:15:32.424 --> 01:15:34.393
I can't recall. It was an endless day.

01:15:34.394 --> 01:15:35.994
Punch Kim Dong Hyun's face.

01:15:36.724 --> 01:15:38.233
- What? - Do you remember?

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:40.094
(We're doing that again?)

01:15:40.264 --> 01:15:41.264
I'm in.

01:15:41.265 --> 01:15:42.663
No, wait. What?

01:15:42.664 --> 01:15:45.373
Stop, you're not well yet. Calm down.

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:46.703
- All of a sudden? - Are we doing it?

01:15:46.704 --> 01:15:48.574
(More fired up than ever)

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:50.244
- I... - Kim Dong Hyun.

01:15:50.674 --> 01:15:52.714
(The reason they're all so pumped up is that...)

01:15:53.474 --> 01:15:57.614
(4 months ago, they knew nothing about boxing.)

01:15:58.214 --> 01:15:59.314
(Annoying, aren't I?)

01:16:00.454 --> 01:16:02.624
(Just keeping their fists up was tough.)

01:16:02.954 --> 01:16:05.124
(Why can't I hit you?)

01:16:05.254 --> 01:16:06.254
(Mom!)

01:16:06.524 --> 01:16:07.524
(Mom!)

01:16:08.094 --> 01:16:10.464
(Lasting for 2 minutes felt almost impossible.)

01:16:11.064 --> 01:16:13.144
(But forget about the Iron Girls from 4 months ago!)

01:16:13.434 --> 01:16:15.764
(They're coming back for a revenge match.)

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:19.374
(An upgraded version of Punch Captain Kim)

01:16:19.774 --> 01:16:22.644
(Iron Girls versus Captain Kim, who will win the revenge match?)

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:23.973
(And...)

01:16:23.974 --> 01:16:25.674
Today, the four of you...

01:16:26.244 --> 01:16:27.343
will fight each other.

01:16:27.344 --> 01:16:28.843
- Us four? - The four of us?

01:16:28.844 --> 01:16:31.154
(Iron Girl versus Iron Girl)

01:16:31.954 --> 01:16:34.383
(Yesterday's friend...)

01:16:34.384 --> 01:16:37.424
(becomes today's opponent.)

01:16:38.054 --> 01:16:41.064
(A ruthless world of competition)

01:16:41.224 --> 01:16:44.134
(Iron Girl versus Iron Girl, how will it end?)

01:16:44.864 --> 01:16:46.410
- I watched the first episode. - I see.

01:16:46.434 --> 01:16:48.863
After seeing it, I was determined...

01:16:48.864 --> 01:16:51.473
to make the girls land ten punches on him.

01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:53.234
Now that the girls have been trained,

01:16:53.334 --> 01:16:56.373
Captain Kim will have to dodge properly.

01:16:56.374 --> 01:16:58.444
From what I know,

01:16:58.844 --> 01:17:01.184
two of you are injured.

01:17:01.244 --> 01:17:03.014
I'm suddenly all better now.

01:17:03.084 --> 01:17:04.084
- For real? - Yes.

01:17:04.114 --> 01:17:08.524
I realized the importance of footwork.

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:10.823
I worked hard to improve it,

01:17:10.824 --> 01:17:12.153
and busted my knees.

01:17:12.154 --> 01:17:13.253
(Ju Hyun also has a knee injury.)

01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:14.893
But I knew a day like this would come,

01:17:14.894 --> 01:17:16.394
so I practiced walking footwork.

01:17:17.064 --> 01:17:19.193
(Everyone will participate with unyielding determination.)

01:17:19.194 --> 01:17:21.464
- I still can't do running footwork. - Hold on.

01:17:21.734 --> 01:17:23.863
- Captain Kim, you didn't... - Yes?

01:17:23.864 --> 01:17:26.204
- wear headgear back then, did you? - I didn't.

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:27.604
What about this time?

01:17:28.404 --> 01:17:29.774
I'm going to wear one today.

01:17:31.144 --> 01:17:32.713
(Danger detected)

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:34.684
I will wear one today.

01:17:34.744 --> 01:17:37.013
- Shall we get ready? - Make me see stars.

01:17:37.014 --> 01:17:39.054
Make me see stars, okay? Really bright ones.

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.524
Before we start training,

01:17:41.684 --> 01:17:43.723
it's good to get your body warmed up.

01:17:43.724 --> 01:17:45.853
I'll give you a spray to use beforehand.

01:17:45.854 --> 01:17:47.793
We warm up, right?

01:17:47.794 --> 01:17:49.424
This helps you do just that.

01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:53.163
- Thank you. Rub it in. - It warms you up.

01:17:53.164 --> 01:17:54.434
Yes, rub it in.

01:17:54.634 --> 01:17:56.234
Me too, since I need to spar too.

01:17:58.304 --> 01:18:00.004
Are you mistaking that for a body oil?

01:18:00.374 --> 01:18:01.573
No, I need a generous amount.

01:18:01.574 --> 01:18:03.174
(Being thorough to fight all four girls)

01:18:03.604 --> 01:18:05.114
Let's at least hit once.

01:18:06.214 --> 01:18:07.214
Seriously.

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:09.013
This is our only chance...

01:18:09.014 --> 01:18:11.354
to hit someone who has fought in the UFC.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:13.553
Captain Kim is wearing his boxing shoes.

01:18:13.554 --> 01:18:15.524
Captain Kim has a pair of boxing shoes?

01:18:16.624 --> 01:18:17.624
Nice.

01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:19.170
(First time seeing him in boxing shoes)

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:20.454
Nice. I like it.

01:18:21.424 --> 01:18:22.824
(The Iron Girls are warming up.)

01:18:23.764 --> 01:18:25.694
(Suddenly charging)

01:18:26.534 --> 01:18:28.040
(Provoking before the match even begins)

01:18:28.064 --> 01:18:30.264
- Don't touch the Blue Corner. - Shoes?

01:18:32.634 --> 01:18:34.673
(Showing off his warm-up)

01:18:34.674 --> 01:18:36.343
Your shoes look weird.

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:37.944
Those shoes seem special.

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:40.443
I'm touching it too.

01:18:40.444 --> 01:18:41.483
Yes, two of them.

01:18:41.484 --> 01:18:43.543
(Targeted attack on the Red Corner)

01:18:43.544 --> 01:18:44.714
The fighting spirit.

01:18:45.254 --> 01:18:46.254
Jab.

01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:47.414
One, two.

01:18:47.654 --> 01:18:48.684
One, two.

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:49.953
One, two, dodge, punch.

01:18:49.954 --> 01:18:51.123
(He's even hitting the mitts now?)

01:18:51.124 --> 01:18:52.154
Up to hooks.

01:18:53.154 --> 01:18:55.324
Captain Kim, why are you doing that?

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:57.393
I'm seizing the initiative.

01:18:57.394 --> 01:18:58.463
Even if I'm not punching,

01:18:58.464 --> 01:18:59.533
I'm seizing the initiative.

01:18:59.534 --> 01:19:00.540
(Why seize it against us?)

01:19:00.564 --> 01:19:02.434
- I'll be on defense only. - Here.

01:19:03.134 --> 01:19:05.874
(But even if he's just trying out, )

01:19:06.304 --> 01:19:08.373
(he's making fierce noises.)

01:19:08.374 --> 01:19:10.343
(Shocked)

01:19:10.344 --> 01:19:11.474
Okay.

01:19:11.714 --> 01:19:12.743
(Groaning)

01:19:12.744 --> 01:19:13.774
(Groaning)

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:16.514
(These are a fighter's punches.)

01:19:16.584 --> 01:19:18.253
Gosh, that's incredible.

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:20.313
You weren't just a celebrity, Captain Kim.

01:19:20.314 --> 01:19:21.854
- You were indeed an athlete. - Right?

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:23.883
- I'm done. - Your hooks are really powerful.

01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:25.194
Right, I'm done.

01:19:25.724 --> 01:19:27.393
(Meanwhile, the first boxer gets ready.)

01:19:27.394 --> 01:19:28.464
Wait.

01:19:28.994 --> 01:19:30.970
- Aren't you hurt, In Ah? - It came flying like this.

01:19:30.994 --> 01:19:32.094
Yes, I am.

01:19:32.264 --> 01:19:34.194
- I'll go slow. - Are you okay?

01:19:35.064 --> 01:19:36.763
Wear this.

01:19:36.764 --> 01:19:37.873
Wear it on top of that.

01:19:37.874 --> 01:19:41.644
Of course. I'm one of those people with weak ankles.

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:44.574
- I'll go slow. - Are you okay?

01:19:45.674 --> 01:19:46.843
(Scared)

01:19:46.844 --> 01:19:48.144
But In Ah is strong.

01:19:49.144 --> 01:19:52.483
Your mouthguard makes it look like you have no teeth.

01:19:52.484 --> 01:19:53.984
- I know, right? - Really?

01:19:54.054 --> 01:19:56.353
You really look like you have no teeth.

01:19:56.354 --> 01:19:58.154
(Captain Kim's terrifying mouthguard)

01:19:58.354 --> 01:19:59.634
I used it during my tournaments.

01:19:59.994 --> 01:20:01.264
My UFC tournaments.

01:20:01.394 --> 01:20:02.423
- After seven years? - Yes.

01:20:02.424 --> 01:20:03.864
- Just because of us? - Yes.

01:20:04.534 --> 01:20:06.463
I'd love to take a good punch like in a match.

01:20:06.464 --> 01:20:08.404
I rarely got hit in matches.

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:11.904
(Meanwhile, In Ah is...)

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:14.344
It's been a while since I wore a mouthguard.

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:16.373
All right, to the center.

01:20:16.374 --> 01:20:17.374
(Everyone is ready.)

01:20:19.474 --> 01:20:21.483
- Okay. - A grand comeback match.

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:22.743
(Simba Seol's grand comeback match)

01:20:22.744 --> 01:20:23.784
Okay.

01:20:24.084 --> 01:20:26.014
- Isn't that foul play? - Right.

01:20:26.084 --> 01:20:27.483
What? What was that just now?

01:20:27.484 --> 01:20:28.484
- Isn't that foul play? - Right.

01:20:28.485 --> 01:20:30.123
(An openly biased referee)

01:20:30.124 --> 01:20:31.793
What? What was that just now?

01:20:31.794 --> 01:20:33.493
- Do your job properly. - Okay.

01:20:33.494 --> 01:20:34.900
- Let's do this. - Don't provoke each other.

01:20:34.924 --> 01:20:36.694
- Okay. - Play fair.

01:20:37.894 --> 01:20:38.963
Go.

01:20:38.964 --> 01:20:39.993
Okay.

01:20:39.994 --> 01:20:41.474
(The two boxers go to their corners.)

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:42.963
The sparring will be one round...

01:20:42.964 --> 01:20:44.473
- of two minutes. - Okay.

01:20:44.474 --> 01:20:45.503
Are you ready?

01:20:45.504 --> 01:20:47.003
Round One.

01:20:47.004 --> 01:20:48.043
(In Ah's revenge match...)

01:20:48.044 --> 01:20:49.143
Box.

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:50.404
(begins.)

01:20:50.474 --> 01:20:51.474
Box.

01:20:51.475 --> 01:20:54.344
(What will Simba Seol's comeback match be like?)

01:20:54.714 --> 01:20:56.014
She has returned.

01:20:56.314 --> 01:20:59.354
(Low, low, high)

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:01.183
That's it. Nice.

01:21:01.184 --> 01:21:02.354
She keeps hitting him.

01:21:02.784 --> 01:21:03.853
Dodge.

01:21:03.854 --> 01:21:05.023
(Pressuring him using different punch combinations)

01:21:05.024 --> 01:21:06.893
- Yes. - Look at how he keeps watching her.

01:21:06.894 --> 01:21:07.894
Dodge.

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:10.394
(Feint, high)

01:21:10.624 --> 01:21:11.633
(Using techniques nonstop)

01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:13.394
- He's not dodging jabs. - Good.

01:21:13.834 --> 01:21:15.633
Captain Kim never looks away.

01:21:15.634 --> 01:21:17.704
(Captain Kim dodges without blinking an eye.)

01:21:18.134 --> 01:21:20.534
(In Ah's punches don't land on him.)

01:21:20.934 --> 01:21:22.614
Why aren't you hitting me? Hit me already.

01:21:23.004 --> 01:21:25.214
Hit me.

01:21:25.944 --> 01:21:27.473
(Enraged)

01:21:27.474 --> 01:21:28.614
Hit me.

01:21:31.084 --> 01:21:33.784
(In Ah throws a rapid series of punches, )

01:21:34.214 --> 01:21:38.254
(and Stun Gun dodges every one.)

01:21:38.424 --> 01:21:40.024
That just now was legendary.

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:41.463
He dodges every punch.

01:21:41.464 --> 01:21:42.794
Stun Gun is still on a roll.

01:21:43.124 --> 01:21:45.994
(In Ah follows him and throws a wide punch.)

01:21:46.964 --> 01:21:49.334
(Captain Kim narrowly evades it.)

01:21:50.404 --> 01:21:52.103
(Throwing a straight with a shout)

01:21:52.104 --> 01:21:53.334
- That's it. Nice. - No.

01:21:55.144 --> 01:21:57.204
(A solid valid strike)

01:21:57.344 --> 01:21:59.513
- That's it. Nice. - Good.

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:01.084
- No. - Good.

01:22:01.144 --> 01:22:02.544
What "no?" I did hit you.

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:03.713
Try and hit me.

01:22:03.714 --> 01:22:04.814
Hit me.

01:22:04.914 --> 01:22:06.053
Come on.

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:07.514
(She ducks in...)

01:22:07.614 --> 01:22:10.383
(and unleashes...)

01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:11.694
(a flurry of punches.)

01:22:12.024 --> 01:22:13.253
You've got him. Nice.

01:22:13.254 --> 01:22:14.894
(In Ah's straight punch lands perfectly.)

01:22:15.724 --> 01:22:20.834
(In Ah used to throw punches at random.)

01:22:22.564 --> 01:22:25.504
(She presses Captain Kim with rapid combinations.)

01:22:25.904 --> 01:22:29.704
(Feint, feint, straight, hook, uppercut)

01:22:30.704 --> 01:22:33.273
(In Ah lashes out with fierce punches, )

01:22:33.274 --> 01:22:35.844
(but Captain Kim evades them all.)

01:22:36.014 --> 01:22:37.814
- Gosh, that's... - He dodges really well.

01:22:39.014 --> 01:22:40.384
- Ten seconds. - Go for it.

01:22:40.454 --> 01:22:42.484
- Punch. Yes, that's it. - Nice.

01:22:42.584 --> 01:22:45.153
(A hook after a high feint)

01:22:45.154 --> 01:22:46.354
That's the feint I meant.

01:22:47.024 --> 01:22:48.063
Nice. Again.

01:22:48.064 --> 01:22:49.824
(Pushing with full force until the very end)

01:22:50.424 --> 01:22:51.463
Yes.

01:22:51.464 --> 01:22:52.533
Stop.

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:54.263
(In Ah's revenge match ends.)

01:22:54.264 --> 01:22:55.564
- Okay. - Okay.

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:58.704
- I hit you. - You didn't.

01:22:59.134 --> 01:23:00.373
- Good job. - Only slightly.

01:23:00.374 --> 01:23:01.574
It barely touched me.

01:23:02.574 --> 01:23:04.203
- Did you catch my hook-feint? - Yes.

01:23:04.204 --> 01:23:05.644
- My combination. - Yes, it hit him.

01:23:05.774 --> 01:23:06.843
Well done.

01:23:06.844 --> 01:23:07.844
(In Ah is excited that her strategy worked.)

01:23:07.845 --> 01:23:09.283
You stayed sharp to dodge the punches.

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:12.684
A few punches that looked deadly just missed me.

01:23:12.814 --> 01:23:14.284
I saw them pass by.

01:23:15.454 --> 01:23:17.754
(Punches flew past Captain Kim.)

01:23:17.854 --> 01:23:20.523
He barely dodges them by maybe 1cm or so.

01:23:20.524 --> 01:23:22.524
That's professional-level dodging.

01:23:23.464 --> 01:23:24.963
Dodging like that puts him...

01:23:24.964 --> 01:23:26.693
at the perfect distance to counterattack.

01:23:26.694 --> 01:23:29.263
But he got hit when I threw two feints.

01:23:29.264 --> 01:23:30.403
Just once.

01:23:30.404 --> 01:23:31.404
- "Just once?" - Twice.

01:23:31.404 --> 01:23:32.404
- Twice. - Twice.

01:23:32.405 --> 01:23:34.274
- More like three times. - You hit me twice.

01:23:35.474 --> 01:23:39.444
(A perfect hook after a feint)

01:23:40.844 --> 01:23:45.384
(In Ah's valid strike landed perfectly.)

01:23:45.584 --> 01:23:47.583
In Ah always had...

01:23:47.584 --> 01:23:51.053
the instinct to land a punch, like a beast.

01:23:51.054 --> 01:23:52.154
But now,

01:23:52.254 --> 01:23:53.523
she's tricked me several times.

01:23:53.524 --> 01:23:54.763
I thought she missed,

01:23:54.764 --> 01:23:56.494
- but it was all a feint. - Well done.

01:23:56.724 --> 01:23:59.034
It's fun. I forgot that boxing was fun.

01:23:59.994 --> 01:24:02.703
From what I can see, Uie will be my toughest opponent.

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:05.503
I prefer boxers who rely on single, heavy blows.

01:24:05.504 --> 01:24:07.373
Uie won't be easy.

01:24:07.374 --> 01:24:09.143
- How come? Why? - Okay.

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:11.713
Even if Captain Kim raises his guard, she'll keep attacking.

01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:14.683
Uie's greatest strength is the number of punches she throws.

01:24:14.684 --> 01:24:17.044
Between the punches to dodge and the ones to take,

01:24:17.584 --> 01:24:19.054
which should I dodge?

01:24:19.184 --> 01:24:20.883
You only need to dodge two punches.

01:24:20.884 --> 01:24:22.554
- One, two. - What?

01:24:23.254 --> 01:24:25.393
- She throws 300 one-twos. - She's hard to predict.

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:26.424
Exactly.

01:24:26.524 --> 01:24:28.564
- Okay. - Uie will be tough.

01:24:28.894 --> 01:24:30.863
Isn't that cheating, like throwing 300 punches?

01:24:30.864 --> 01:24:31.893
No.

01:24:31.894 --> 01:24:33.233
Play fair.

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:34.633
- Touch gloves. Okay. - Okay.

01:24:34.634 --> 01:24:35.664
Corners.

01:24:35.864 --> 01:24:36.963
Uie can't be analyzed.

01:24:36.964 --> 01:24:40.234
Feel how strong her punches are, despite her innocent-looking eyes.

01:24:40.504 --> 01:24:41.973
Round One.

01:24:41.974 --> 01:24:43.043
(Uie's revenge match...)

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:44.143
Box.

01:24:44.144 --> 01:24:46.014
(begins.)

01:24:46.174 --> 01:24:47.174
Box.

01:24:47.175 --> 01:24:48.813
(She rushes in with innocent eyes.)

01:24:48.814 --> 01:24:49.843
I'm excited.

01:24:49.844 --> 01:24:51.853
(Probing with jabs...)

01:24:51.854 --> 01:24:52.984
(before landing a body shot)

01:24:53.484 --> 01:24:55.383
(Jab, jab, two, hook)

01:24:55.384 --> 01:24:56.424
- Yes. - Unbelievable.

01:24:57.024 --> 01:24:58.953
(Her first attack...)

01:24:58.954 --> 01:25:00.994
(hits the bullseye.)

01:25:01.864 --> 01:25:03.324
She hit him right away.

01:25:04.324 --> 01:25:06.063
(Stun Gun retreats, backing away.)

01:25:06.064 --> 01:25:08.234
The attack was supposed to end after the right hook.

01:25:08.264 --> 01:25:09.534
But a jab after that?

01:25:10.034 --> 01:25:11.914
- That was amazing. - Follow it up with a hook.

01:25:11.974 --> 01:25:13.414
- Well done. That's it. - This is...

01:25:13.974 --> 01:25:15.043
- Yes. - Again?

01:25:15.044 --> 01:25:16.284
- Nice. - That's a long attack.

01:25:17.004 --> 01:25:18.174
What is this?

01:25:18.774 --> 01:25:20.374
(Uie used to throw playful punches.)

01:25:20.844 --> 01:25:22.413
(Now, she observes and attacks.)

01:25:22.414 --> 01:25:23.813
Punch again.

01:25:23.814 --> 01:25:26.983
(Uie has grown into a boxer with a deadly one-two.)

01:25:26.984 --> 01:25:28.054
That's it. Nice.

01:25:28.154 --> 01:25:29.323
Good.

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:30.753
(Captain Kim is busy dodging her punches.)

01:25:30.754 --> 01:25:31.793
Yes.

01:25:31.794 --> 01:25:34.094
Don't put any distance between you two.

01:25:34.194 --> 01:25:35.224
- Keep going. - Gosh.

01:25:35.764 --> 01:25:36.923
Here he comes.

01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:37.993
- Punch. - Gosh.

01:25:37.994 --> 01:25:39.794
(Focused until the very end)

01:25:40.264 --> 01:25:41.463
(Taking a knee guard)

01:25:41.464 --> 01:25:42.984
- Until the end. - She's watching him.

01:25:43.734 --> 01:25:45.303
(Uie persistently throws punches.)

01:25:45.304 --> 01:25:46.834
- Okay. - That's it. Good.

01:25:47.204 --> 01:25:48.343
Punch. Yes.

01:25:48.344 --> 01:25:49.543
Punch. Nice.

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:51.044
Good job. Hurry. Again.

01:25:51.274 --> 01:25:52.573
Stop.

01:25:52.574 --> 01:25:54.113
- Uie. - Well done.

01:25:54.114 --> 01:25:55.794
- She throws countless punches. - Exactly.

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.183
(Even the almighty Stun Gun is tired.)

01:25:57.184 --> 01:25:58.884
(Plopping)

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:01.353
- That was insane, Uie. - Really?

01:26:01.354 --> 01:26:03.124
I think you threw at least 200 punches.

01:26:03.284 --> 01:26:04.924
Coach Kim, is it foul play to kneel down?

01:26:05.024 --> 01:26:07.024
- Yes, that's a foul. - Sorry.

01:26:07.724 --> 01:26:09.394
- "A foul?" - I broke the rules.

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:10.963
You bent down quite deeply.

01:26:10.964 --> 01:26:12.794
- I have many techniques... - Yes?

01:26:12.964 --> 01:26:14.864
To unsettle my opponent when I'm in a pinch.

01:26:15.104 --> 01:26:17.364
I rarely go down on my knees.

01:26:17.734 --> 01:26:20.333
Captain Kim moves around like crazy.

01:26:20.334 --> 01:26:21.473
- "What is he doing?" - That is how...

01:26:21.474 --> 01:26:22.544
I throw my opponent off.

01:26:23.104 --> 01:26:25.474
"What is he doing? Why is he dropping to one knee?"

01:26:26.144 --> 01:26:28.714
(What is he doing?)

01:26:29.044 --> 01:26:31.214
(Punishing him right away)

01:26:31.514 --> 01:26:34.853
I thought he was proposing to me.

01:26:34.854 --> 01:26:36.684
(Will you spar with me?)

01:26:37.254 --> 01:26:38.624
(Embarrassed)

01:26:38.894 --> 01:26:39.993
It was super entertaining.

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:41.123
Uie is...

01:26:41.124 --> 01:26:42.323
- a little timid. - True.

01:26:42.324 --> 01:26:43.563
Right?

01:26:43.564 --> 01:26:45.233
In exchange for your timidness,

01:26:45.234 --> 01:26:47.494
- your defense has improved greatly. - I agree.

01:26:47.894 --> 01:26:50.103
On top of that, you've gotten...

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:52.603
much better at attacking with your lead hand.

01:26:52.604 --> 01:26:53.873
- Yes. - You've improved greatly.

01:26:53.874 --> 01:26:55.244
(Satisfied)

01:26:56.074 --> 01:26:57.173
Are you ready?

01:26:57.174 --> 01:26:58.344
(Who is the next boxer?)

01:26:58.544 --> 01:26:59.743
Get ready.

01:26:59.744 --> 01:27:00.744
What's up with those two? They're hilarious.

01:27:00.745 --> 01:27:01.944
Round One.

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:03.714
Box.

01:27:04.884 --> 01:27:07.754
(Rushing out as soon as the match begins)

01:27:10.554 --> 01:27:13.094
(Ju Hyun starts with jabs.)

01:27:15.824 --> 01:27:19.463
(She successfully hits Captain Kim within 8 seconds.)

01:27:19.464 --> 01:27:21.434
Ju Hyun hit him as soon as the match started.

01:27:23.264 --> 01:27:25.633
(Throwing a low and high feint)

01:27:25.634 --> 01:27:26.734
That's it.

01:27:27.404 --> 01:27:31.204
(Stun Gun dodges at lightning speed.)

01:27:31.414 --> 01:27:34.074
(He dodges skillfully in every direction.)

01:27:35.314 --> 01:27:36.814
- Yes. - Nice.

01:27:37.914 --> 01:27:38.983
- That's it. - Yes.

01:27:38.984 --> 01:27:40.753
(This time, she lands a jab on his chin.)

01:27:40.754 --> 01:27:41.784
Hold on.

01:27:41.824 --> 01:27:42.883
(1 punch)

01:27:42.884 --> 01:27:44.453
(2 punches)

01:27:44.454 --> 01:27:45.523
He got trapped.

01:27:45.524 --> 01:27:47.294
Punch. That's it. Keep watching him.

01:27:48.264 --> 01:27:52.764
(Eventually, Stun Gun's legs give way.)

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:54.904
You've got good stamina.

01:27:56.264 --> 01:27:59.733
(Ju Hyun used to have neither technique...)

01:27:59.734 --> 01:28:02.374
(nor stamina.)

01:28:03.074 --> 01:28:06.974
(Now, she can attack for a full round.)

01:28:07.374 --> 01:28:08.983
That's it, a flurry of punches.

01:28:08.984 --> 01:28:10.813
(She has grown into a menacing boxer.)

01:28:10.814 --> 01:28:11.984
Stop.

01:28:12.514 --> 01:28:14.414
(Ju Hyun's revenge match ends.)

01:28:14.454 --> 01:28:15.454
Round One.

01:28:15.455 --> 01:28:16.495
(The next and final round)

01:28:16.984 --> 01:28:18.023
Box.

01:28:18.024 --> 01:28:19.344
(Sae Rok's revenge match begins.)

01:28:19.554 --> 01:28:20.753
(Attacking fiercely from the start)

01:28:20.754 --> 01:28:21.964
She's fast.

01:28:22.494 --> 01:28:23.564
You're strong.

01:28:24.424 --> 01:28:25.534
Your punches are heavy.

01:28:26.794 --> 01:28:28.163
(Landing punches)

01:28:28.164 --> 01:28:29.233
Stay calm.

01:28:29.234 --> 01:28:31.063
(A heavy straight punch)

01:28:31.064 --> 01:28:32.503
- Do you need an ambulance? - Again.

01:28:32.504 --> 01:28:33.904
Chase after him.

01:28:34.274 --> 01:28:35.274
Nice.

01:28:37.804 --> 01:28:38.814
(Screaming)

01:28:38.844 --> 01:28:40.814
(Captain Kim suddenly goes down?)

01:28:40.874 --> 01:28:42.884
She stepped on my foot.

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:44.784
(While taking quick steps, )

01:28:44.884 --> 01:28:46.614
(she ends up stepping on his foot.)

01:28:48.284 --> 01:28:49.323
Two.

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:50.984
(The gentle step...)

01:28:51.384 --> 01:28:52.894
(knocks him down immediately.)

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:54.723
- Get up. Hurry up. - Get up.

01:28:54.724 --> 01:28:56.494
Stop wasting time, Captain Kim.

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:57.664
What?

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:59.633
One, two,

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:02.233
- three, four... - She stepped on my foot.

01:29:02.234 --> 01:29:03.834
(The biased referee is cheerful.)

01:29:03.904 --> 01:29:05.934
- Okay. - Seven, eight, okay.

01:29:06.104 --> 01:29:07.574
- We chose a bad referee. - Box.

01:29:10.244 --> 01:29:12.144
(Sae Rok corners him once again.)

01:29:13.174 --> 01:29:15.283
Stay calm. Don't rush.

01:29:15.284 --> 01:29:18.854
(Captain Kim is busy dodging the flurry of punches.)

01:29:20.584 --> 01:29:21.624
(Screaming)

01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:23.524
(Screaming)

01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:26.724
(Having no energy left to throw punches, )

01:29:27.354 --> 01:29:29.864
(Sae Rok collapsed before even 2 minutes had passed.)

01:29:30.594 --> 01:29:33.433
- That's good. Again. Ten seconds. - Nice.

01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:35.733
- Good. Well done. - Great.

01:29:35.734 --> 01:29:37.854
(Gained stamina to go all out in the last 10 seconds)

01:29:38.034 --> 01:29:39.273
You're almost there.

01:29:39.274 --> 01:29:40.634
Stop.

01:29:40.674 --> 01:29:42.344
Greet each other.

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:43.873
She's different, right?

01:29:43.874 --> 01:29:45.820
Sae Rok is different, isn't she? She's the best, right?

01:29:45.844 --> 01:29:46.873
Unbelievable, right?

01:29:46.874 --> 01:29:48.883
Back when we didn't know anything,

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:50.213
we also fought for two minutes, didn't we?

01:29:50.214 --> 01:29:51.983
We thought we were throwing strong punches,

01:29:51.984 --> 01:29:53.713
but they were actually weak ones.

01:29:53.714 --> 01:29:57.923
Today, we finally understood what Coach Kim meant,

01:29:57.924 --> 01:30:00.593
and it felt like some of our punches actually landed on him.

01:30:00.594 --> 01:30:02.493
It's only today that we've realized...

01:30:02.494 --> 01:30:04.394
just how much we've improved.

01:30:04.524 --> 01:30:05.563
(Feeling proud)

01:30:05.564 --> 01:30:07.463
Coach Kim's eyes have become teary.

01:30:07.464 --> 01:30:09.663
- Don't cry. - Coach Kim is tender-hearted.

01:30:09.664 --> 01:30:10.964
- I really... - He cries easily.

01:30:11.334 --> 01:30:14.803
We've worked so hard that...

01:30:14.804 --> 01:30:16.244
- even Coach Kim was moved. - Right.

01:30:16.274 --> 01:30:18.004
Honestly,

01:30:18.104 --> 01:30:19.713
I think you've built enough technique...

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:22.184
and discovered your own style.

01:30:22.444 --> 01:30:25.414
Our tournament is in ten days, right?

01:30:25.554 --> 01:30:27.153
Think about the opponent you'll likely face,

01:30:27.154 --> 01:30:29.524
and about everything we've trained for each day up to now.

01:30:29.654 --> 01:30:31.853
- What are we doing? - Today, the four of you...

01:30:31.854 --> 01:30:33.623
- What are we doing? - will fight each other.

01:30:33.624 --> 01:30:35.063
- Us four? - The four of us?

01:30:35.064 --> 01:30:36.094
Yes.

01:30:37.094 --> 01:30:38.664
(Two months ago)

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:44.974
(They were scared even before it began.)

01:30:45.734 --> 01:30:48.704
(The first supervised sparring was over in a flash.)

01:30:49.104 --> 01:30:51.373
(The second supervised sparring...)

01:30:51.374 --> 01:30:52.443
(was still all about struggling to adjust.)

01:30:52.444 --> 01:30:53.814
(She's super fast.)

01:30:55.244 --> 01:30:58.884
(During the three sparring sessions, )

01:30:59.984 --> 01:31:03.484
(as they got punched with real intensity, they discovered...)

01:31:03.924 --> 01:31:06.994
(their own strengths and styles while their skills improved.)

01:31:08.254 --> 01:31:11.224
(The final sparring opponent: the Iron Girls)

01:31:11.424 --> 01:31:13.634
Rather than going all out,

01:31:13.734 --> 01:31:15.433
focus on testing whether your techniques work.

01:31:15.434 --> 01:31:17.504
- Just until, "This would work." - Exactly.

01:31:17.604 --> 01:31:20.433
All combat sports athletes train like this most often.

01:31:20.434 --> 01:31:22.303
A sparring session with teammates,

01:31:22.304 --> 01:31:23.943
simulating real matches and adapting to the opponent's style.

01:31:23.944 --> 01:31:25.650
Athletes mostly train through full matches.

01:31:25.674 --> 01:31:27.373
- I'm in. - It sounds fun.

01:31:27.374 --> 01:31:29.883
Uie and Ju Hyun will spar together as partners.

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:32.114
(Park Ju Hyun versus Uie)

01:31:32.314 --> 01:31:33.384
- It's us. - Us two.

01:31:34.114 --> 01:31:35.184
Between roommates.

01:31:35.684 --> 01:31:37.164
You're great matches for one another.

01:31:37.354 --> 01:31:39.194
- An in-fighter and out-boxer. - The opposite.

01:31:39.224 --> 01:31:41.270
- And an in-fighter and out-boxer. - An in-fighter and out-boxer.

01:31:41.294 --> 01:31:43.163
- Yes. - Good. The first match.

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:46.164
Uie versus Park Ju Hyun. Please get ready.

01:31:49.164 --> 01:31:53.634
(Ju Hyun and Uie prepare to spar.)

01:31:55.144 --> 01:31:57.974
The sparring session will be 2 rounds of 2 minutes each.

01:31:58.614 --> 01:31:59.744
I love you, Uie.

01:32:00.474 --> 01:32:02.783
- With that, Ji Hyun will punch Uie. - After saying that...

01:32:02.784 --> 01:32:04.443
- She'll punch her. - That's scarier.

01:32:04.444 --> 01:32:06.683
- That's scarier. - Ju Hyun's eyes will change.

01:32:06.684 --> 01:32:08.214
I really like you, you know?

01:32:08.554 --> 01:32:09.924
All right. Ready?

01:32:10.824 --> 01:32:12.194
(Suddenly changing)

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:15.524
(Her mad-mode is on.)

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:19.294
(The in-fighter who calmly...)

01:32:20.164 --> 01:32:23.164
(sizes up the opponent before charging in like a bull)

01:32:24.064 --> 01:32:26.304
(Mad Boxer Park Ju Hyun)

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:27.904
(And her opponent)

01:32:28.234 --> 01:32:30.144
(Blessed with incredible reach)

01:32:31.074 --> 01:32:34.314
(Dominating everyone with just the one-two combination)

01:32:35.284 --> 01:32:37.484
(One-Two Uie)

01:32:37.614 --> 01:32:39.714
Get ready. Round One.

01:32:39.884 --> 01:32:41.253
An in-fighter and out-boxer.

01:32:41.254 --> 01:32:42.254
Box.

01:32:42.255 --> 01:32:43.684
(Round 1 begins.)

01:32:49.864 --> 01:32:51.440
(They jab at each other, sizing each other up.)

01:32:51.464 --> 01:32:52.893
(Ju Hyun attempts a body shot.)

01:32:52.894 --> 01:32:54.864
(Uie lands a straight punch.)

01:32:55.564 --> 01:32:58.204
(A feisty straight punch)

01:32:59.504 --> 01:33:02.003
(Jabbing after parrying)

01:33:02.004 --> 01:33:03.904
Feint, retreat, and then punch.

01:33:04.174 --> 01:33:06.243
- Be quick. - Yes, that's it.

01:33:06.244 --> 01:33:07.943
(A body shot after a feint)

01:33:07.944 --> 01:33:09.914
Yes, that's it. Move high and low.

01:33:10.284 --> 01:33:11.930
- Move high and low. - The intensity went up right away.

01:33:11.954 --> 01:33:13.874
- The girls are real boxers now. - High and low.

01:33:14.354 --> 01:33:15.584
High and low.

01:33:15.624 --> 01:33:17.283
(Probing like a real fight)

01:33:17.284 --> 01:33:18.754
Yes, fool her like that.

01:33:19.294 --> 01:33:20.423
Nice. Good.

01:33:20.424 --> 01:33:21.724
- What? - Well done.

01:33:21.994 --> 01:33:23.864
(A cross-counter)

01:33:24.024 --> 01:33:25.734
(Another cross-counter)

01:33:25.794 --> 01:33:27.734
(Valid strike)

01:33:27.834 --> 01:33:30.434
- Again. Watch your opponent. - Stretch out.

01:33:30.764 --> 01:33:32.274
(Ju Hyun aims for the low.)

01:33:32.504 --> 01:33:35.074
That's it. Get up now. That's how you do it.

01:33:35.144 --> 01:33:37.474
- Uie slipped away well. - She has improved.

01:33:37.574 --> 01:33:38.914
Guard up, Ju Hyun.

01:33:39.114 --> 01:33:40.554
- Move in with your guard up. - Yes.

01:33:41.114 --> 01:33:42.914
(Calmly looking for the right timing)

01:33:43.044 --> 01:33:44.343
(Striking immediately)

01:33:44.344 --> 01:33:45.354
(Parrying)

01:33:46.014 --> 01:33:47.514
- That's it. - Park Ju!

01:33:47.584 --> 01:33:48.953
That was a smart move by Ju Hyun.

01:33:48.954 --> 01:33:50.314
(A perfectly-timed jab once again)

01:33:50.554 --> 01:33:51.624
That was great timing.

01:33:54.224 --> 01:33:56.624
(Jabbing at each other to find the perfect timing to attack)

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:57.794
(A valid strike by Ju Hyun)

01:33:58.264 --> 01:33:59.840
(After calmly observing Uie's movements, )

01:33:59.864 --> 01:34:01.764
(Ju Hyun lands a jab through her open guard.)

01:34:01.864 --> 01:34:03.263
- That was a long punch by Ju Hyun. - Well done.

01:34:03.264 --> 01:34:05.574
She overcame the long reach with the jab.

01:34:05.734 --> 01:34:07.454
(Uie kept her eyes on Ju Hyun's movements.)

01:34:07.574 --> 01:34:08.574
(A parry after a cross-counter)

01:34:08.574 --> 01:34:09.574
Good.

01:34:09.804 --> 01:34:11.744

01:34:12.214 --> 01:34:13.214
Yes.

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:14.214

(A straight punch and a valid jab)

01:34:17.484 --> 01:34:18.514
That's it. Well done.

01:34:19.084 --> 01:34:20.113
Both of you did well.

01:34:20.114 --> 01:34:21.153
(Ju Hyun's jab pierces through.)

01:34:21.154 --> 01:34:22.154
- Both of them are... - Follow the two...

01:34:22.155 --> 01:34:23.754
- They're good. - with a hook.

01:34:25.124 --> 01:34:26.393
Staying composed is good.

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:28.054
Uie's current rhythm is nice.

01:34:29.394 --> 01:34:31.494
- Nice, Ju Hyun. - Amazing.

01:34:33.094 --> 01:34:34.240
- Ten seconds. - She targets...

01:34:34.264 --> 01:34:35.303
- Nice rhythm. - any opening.

01:34:35.304 --> 01:34:36.734
All right, good.

01:34:37.264 --> 01:34:38.904
That was too wide. Make it short.

01:34:39.074 --> 01:34:40.134
Yes.

01:34:40.434 --> 01:34:41.774
(A straight punch)

01:34:42.204 --> 01:34:44.073
(Ju Hyun's straight punch pierced through the reach.)

01:34:44.074 --> 01:34:45.343
- Ju Hyun. - Both of you did well.

01:34:45.344 --> 01:34:46.344
- Just now... - Stop.

01:34:46.345 --> 01:34:48.544
(Round 1 ends.)

01:34:50.714 --> 01:34:53.214
- You two are amazing. - It was so much fun.

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:55.353
- Are you okay? - Was I too strong?

01:34:55.354 --> 01:34:57.154
- No, you're fine. - Am I too strong?

01:34:57.324 --> 01:34:59.824
All right, come over here. Well done.

01:35:00.054 --> 01:35:02.594
Uie counterattacked perfectly at the right time.

01:35:02.824 --> 01:35:04.584
Ju Hyun responded well with a cross-counter.

01:35:04.724 --> 01:35:06.293
- You two are incredible. - That's how it's done.

01:35:06.294 --> 01:35:08.563
You two know each other's techniques.

01:35:08.564 --> 01:35:09.934
You've quickly figured out...

01:35:10.004 --> 01:35:13.403
how to block and turn it against one another.

01:35:13.404 --> 01:35:14.803
I can't reach her.

01:35:14.804 --> 01:35:16.403
Ju Hyun, your timing was great.

01:35:16.404 --> 01:35:17.743
Now, connect it with one more move.

01:35:17.744 --> 01:35:20.043
After a high-low combination, follow up with a hook.

01:35:20.044 --> 01:35:23.044
And Uie, what did I tell you to do after your one-two?

01:35:23.144 --> 01:35:24.884
- Your lead hand... - Two, hook.

01:35:25.144 --> 01:35:27.754
- That's what you should do. Got it? - Thank you.

01:35:27.814 --> 01:35:29.153
Follow through, okay?

01:35:29.154 --> 01:35:30.353
- All right. Corners. - You two are amazing.

01:35:30.354 --> 01:35:31.754
You're like real boxers right now.

01:35:32.024 --> 01:35:33.664
This is like professional-level training.

01:35:34.024 --> 01:35:35.193
They're really skilled.

01:35:35.194 --> 01:35:36.223
- That was fun. - Well done.

01:35:36.224 --> 01:35:37.863
Both of them can read and punch well.

01:35:37.864 --> 01:35:38.934
The last round.

01:35:39.994 --> 01:35:41.063
- Two, then a hook. - Well done.

01:35:41.064 --> 01:35:43.003
(Reviewing her Round 2 task)

01:35:43.004 --> 01:35:44.504
(Recharged with madness)

01:35:44.734 --> 01:35:45.734
Box.

01:35:45.735 --> 01:35:46.804
(Round 2 begins.)

01:35:50.574 --> 01:35:52.474
Stay calm, everyone. You're doing well.

01:35:54.574 --> 01:35:55.583
Yes.

01:35:55.584 --> 01:35:58.184
(After parrying, Uie jabs.)

01:35:58.284 --> 01:35:59.353

01:35:59.354 --> 01:36:00.813
Yes. Nice one.

01:36:00.814 --> 01:36:02.284
Ju Hyun has great timing.

01:36:02.854 --> 01:36:04.984
(Ju Hyun kept looking for the perfect moment.)

01:36:05.024 --> 01:36:06.154
- That's it. - Yes.

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:07.823
(After defending, )

01:36:07.824 --> 01:36:09.304
(she strikes at just the right time.)

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:12.294
(Dodge)

01:36:12.594 --> 01:36:13.940
(She dodges every punch from Uie, )

01:36:13.964 --> 01:36:15.403
(then jabs without hesitation.)

01:36:15.404 --> 01:36:16.933
Her timing is spot on.

01:36:16.934 --> 01:36:19.473
(Ju Hyun has a sharp sense for timing and spotting openings.)

01:36:19.474 --> 01:36:21.873
Good. Well done.

01:36:21.874 --> 01:36:23.194
(Launching another fierce attack)

01:36:23.274 --> 01:36:26.144
(Uie watches Ju Hyun carefully.)

01:36:27.744 --> 01:36:28.983
- Nice. - Goodness.

01:36:28.984 --> 01:36:30.484
You're doing great, Uie.

01:36:31.084 --> 01:36:32.790
- That's it. Punch when you move in. - Uie.

01:36:32.814 --> 01:36:34.213
- Dodge. - Be tricky, Uie.

01:36:34.214 --> 01:36:35.284
Punch. Well done.

01:36:35.924 --> 01:36:36.953
(Groaning)

01:36:36.954 --> 01:36:38.323
(Using her long reach, she lands a straight.)

01:36:38.324 --> 01:36:39.493
- Be tricky, Uie. - Punch. Well done.

01:36:39.494 --> 01:36:41.053
- That was a long reach. - Good.

01:36:41.054 --> 01:36:42.174
She has a really long reach.

01:36:42.364 --> 01:36:44.484
I didn't think I'd get hit, but her reach is so long.

01:36:45.364 --> 01:36:46.494
Come on. Keep going.

01:36:47.964 --> 01:36:49.034
Continue.

01:36:49.064 --> 01:36:51.603
Watch carefully. That's it. Again.

01:36:51.604 --> 01:36:53.274
Attack again. Punch.

01:36:53.574 --> 01:36:54.974
- Nice, Park Ju. - That's it.

01:36:55.374 --> 01:36:57.844
(Guard up, a straight punch)

01:36:58.044 --> 01:36:59.404
(A cross-counter at the same time)

01:36:59.714 --> 01:37:01.114
(As Uie goes for a one-two, )

01:37:01.174 --> 01:37:03.214
(Ju Hyun's jab slips through.)

01:37:03.314 --> 01:37:04.843

01:37:04.844 --> 01:37:06.254
- Nice, Park Ju. - Go.

01:37:06.314 --> 01:37:07.583
(But Uie countered with a straight.)

01:37:07.584 --> 01:37:08.744
- Nice, Park Ju. - That's it.

01:37:09.024 --> 01:37:10.584
- Both of them are great. - Good.

01:37:10.784 --> 01:37:12.093
You're both playing mind games.

01:37:12.094 --> 01:37:14.154
That's it. Nice one.

01:37:15.094 --> 01:37:16.124
That's it.

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:17.564
That's it.

01:37:18.224 --> 01:37:20.133
That's it. Nice one.

01:37:20.134 --> 01:37:22.064
(Ju Hyun lands a perfect straight punch.)

01:37:22.634 --> 01:37:24.233
(Gwang Bok is on a roll.)

01:37:24.234 --> 01:37:25.933
- A counter. - Yes, that was great.

01:37:25.934 --> 01:37:26.950
(Ju Hyun waits to attack again.)

01:37:26.974 --> 01:37:28.273
- You followed up well, Ju Hyun. - Gosh.

01:37:28.274 --> 01:37:29.634
- That cross-counter was... - Yes.

01:37:29.774 --> 01:37:31.704
Follow up. Nice. Good job just now.

01:37:32.144 --> 01:37:34.674
(Trying a body shot after a feint)

01:37:34.774 --> 01:37:36.684
(But Uie seizes the moment to counter...)

01:37:36.844 --> 01:37:40.053
(with a flurry of one-twos, her specialty.)

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:41.813
Well done. That was good.

01:37:41.814 --> 01:37:42.984
Great job, Uie.

01:37:43.084 --> 01:37:45.004
- Great job, Uie. - The body shot was a mistake.

01:37:45.154 --> 01:37:46.400
- You're right. - That two was great.

01:37:46.424 --> 01:37:50.224
(Ju Hyun focuses again and watches for the right timing.)

01:37:51.094 --> 01:37:52.394
Yes. Great. Watch carefully.

01:37:52.464 --> 01:37:53.663
(A long punch landed instantly.)

01:37:53.664 --> 01:37:54.964
(Staggering)

01:37:55.234 --> 01:37:56.234
Eyes on each other.

01:37:56.234 --> 01:37:57.234
(Sparta, keep going!)

01:37:57.534 --> 01:37:58.873
(Are you good?)

01:37:58.874 --> 01:38:00.734
They're both eyeing each other.

01:38:01.274 --> 01:38:03.344
Try to land a high punch. Yes, good job.

01:38:04.404 --> 01:38:05.444
That's it.

01:38:05.814 --> 01:38:07.614
(Ju Hyun lands a perfect jab.)

01:38:07.774 --> 01:38:09.984
How can she endure that long reach?

01:38:11.384 --> 01:38:13.054
Ten seconds. Come on.

01:38:13.784 --> 01:38:15.354
- That's it. Nice one. - What?

01:38:16.284 --> 01:38:20.254
(Uie's valid strike, Ju Hyun's valid strike)

01:38:20.524 --> 01:38:22.644
(Shocked by the fierce attack all the way to the end)

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:24.824
Well done.

01:38:25.434 --> 01:38:26.434
Stop.

01:38:26.435 --> 01:38:28.494
(Round 2 ends.)

01:38:28.964 --> 01:38:30.140
- Good job. - Did it not hurt?

01:38:30.164 --> 01:38:31.564
- No. Are you okay? - Was it okay?

01:38:31.934 --> 01:38:33.134
Well done. Greet each other.

01:38:35.334 --> 01:38:37.473
- Why are you both so good? - That was crazy.

01:38:37.474 --> 01:38:39.513
- That was so much fun. - Good job.

01:38:39.514 --> 01:38:41.014
Please have one more round.

01:38:41.074 --> 01:38:42.843
- Seriously. - That's how professionals train.

01:38:42.844 --> 01:38:44.213
I was so shocked.

01:38:44.214 --> 01:38:45.653
Despite this level of intensity,

01:38:45.654 --> 01:38:47.454
the two of them could train...

01:38:47.784 --> 01:38:50.300
without getting their feelings hurt. They were like professionals.

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:52.294
I know...

01:38:52.654 --> 01:38:53.954
her style.

01:38:55.194 --> 01:38:56.223
I know her style.

01:38:56.224 --> 01:38:58.464
I know that I'll take three hits for a chance.

01:38:58.994 --> 01:39:00.663
At first, I got closer.

01:39:00.664 --> 01:39:02.963
I could see her going for a two,

01:39:02.964 --> 01:39:04.334
so I dodged and still got hit.

01:39:05.104 --> 01:39:07.544
(In Round 2, they were looking for the right time to attack.)

01:39:08.674 --> 01:39:11.904
(She dodged, but the punch went straight to her face.)

01:39:11.974 --> 01:39:14.174
I didn't think that I'd get hit. You have a long reach.

01:39:14.374 --> 01:39:15.944
- It's long. - Her reach is so long.

01:39:15.984 --> 01:39:17.384
Uie,

01:39:17.514 --> 01:39:18.514
you did really well.

01:39:18.515 --> 01:39:20.413
The waterwheel punches practically disappeared.

01:39:20.414 --> 01:39:21.613
- That's right. - Really?

01:39:21.614 --> 01:39:22.623
- Yes. - That's right.

01:39:22.624 --> 01:39:23.683
- She stopped doing this. - Just now,

01:39:23.684 --> 01:39:25.593
the punches were precise.

01:39:25.594 --> 01:39:27.794
- Really? - Your punches are precise now.

01:39:27.994 --> 01:39:31.763
(In the previous sparring, Uie showed the waterwheel punches.)

01:39:31.764 --> 01:39:33.734
(However, in today's sparring)

01:39:34.094 --> 01:39:35.233
(Valid strike)

01:39:35.234 --> 01:39:37.954
(She stretched out her long arms and struck the opponent precisely.)

01:39:38.034 --> 01:39:40.003
(Even afterward, she didn't show the waterwheel punches.)

01:39:40.004 --> 01:39:42.344
(She made valid strikes.)

01:39:42.474 --> 01:39:43.944
I couldn't attack.

01:39:44.204 --> 01:39:45.373
But you're very strong.

01:39:45.374 --> 01:39:47.213
She's really good at attacking at the right time.

01:39:47.214 --> 01:39:48.943
I know. She's really good at timing her attacks.

01:39:48.944 --> 01:39:50.943
Among people I've sparred with,

01:39:50.944 --> 01:39:52.713
- she was the most difficult. - That's right.

01:39:52.714 --> 01:39:53.883
Why was I the most difficult?

01:39:53.884 --> 01:39:56.324
Even though her eye level was below mine,

01:39:56.454 --> 01:39:59.223
- she threw precise punches upward. - That's right.

01:39:59.224 --> 01:40:00.994
I couldn't dodge.

01:40:01.294 --> 01:40:02.323
(She sought out the right timing...)

01:40:02.324 --> 01:40:05.024
(and punched without hesitation.)

01:40:05.264 --> 01:40:08.133
(Ju Hyun saw and punched well throughout the round.)

01:40:08.134 --> 01:40:09.333
At the right time,

01:40:09.334 --> 01:40:10.633
she overcame her short height and attacked.

01:40:10.634 --> 01:40:12.173
- Her timing was amazing. - I know.

01:40:12.174 --> 01:40:13.433
It isn't easy to do that.

01:40:13.434 --> 01:40:14.703
She has sharp eyes.

01:40:14.704 --> 01:40:15.704
(I'm the boxer with no losses, Park Ju Hyun.)

01:40:15.705 --> 01:40:17.520
- She was so cool. - Her footwork was good too.

01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:19.543
Two strikes were perfect.

01:40:19.544 --> 01:40:21.013
They were the strikes...

01:40:21.014 --> 01:40:22.854
a judge could give a standing eight count for.

01:40:23.144 --> 01:40:25.553
(A flurry in Round 2)

01:40:25.554 --> 01:40:27.614
(Her jab was timed perfectly.)

01:40:27.714 --> 01:40:29.824
(The second punch also came at the right time.)

01:40:30.154 --> 01:40:33.254
(Uie's head was thrown back.)

01:40:33.354 --> 01:40:36.264
She had some clean hits.

01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:37.893
(Well done, Park Ju Hyun.)

01:40:37.894 --> 01:40:40.333
Today's sparring was beneficial...

01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:41.633
- for everyone's growth. - Seriously.

01:40:41.634 --> 01:40:42.903
- Thank you. - It was so cool.

01:40:42.904 --> 01:40:44.503
- I love you. - Same here.

01:40:44.504 --> 01:40:46.604
- It was the real deal. - Seriously.

01:40:46.634 --> 01:40:48.003
All right. Now comes...

01:40:48.004 --> 01:40:49.543
- the next sparring. - Okay.

01:40:49.544 --> 01:40:52.514
It's Keum Sae Rok versus Seol In Ah. Get ready.

01:40:53.244 --> 01:40:55.643
As you throw jabs,

01:40:55.644 --> 01:40:58.344
- give feints, okay? - Okay.

01:40:58.384 --> 01:40:59.783
- Do other things when you practice. - I should focus on what I did.

01:40:59.784 --> 01:41:01.914
Now, focus on fooling your opponent...

01:41:01.984 --> 01:41:03.184
and throwing a two.

01:41:05.384 --> 01:41:06.654
It has been a while.

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:10.193
(In Ah is sparring 3 weeks after the 1st tournament.)

01:41:10.194 --> 01:41:12.093
Sae Rok's reach is incredibly long.

01:41:12.094 --> 01:41:14.834
That's right. That's why you need to go in there.

01:41:17.704 --> 01:41:19.803
(She enters the ring in a nervous and excited state.)

01:41:19.804 --> 01:41:22.274
It has been so long.

01:41:23.344 --> 01:41:26.713
(Sae Rok is ready as well.)

01:41:26.714 --> 01:41:29.714
You can tell that their punches will be painful.

01:41:30.244 --> 01:41:31.313
I'm in your care.

01:41:31.314 --> 01:41:32.353
- Let's go. - Okay.

01:41:32.354 --> 01:41:33.583
- I love you. - Like what you saw earlier,

01:41:33.584 --> 01:41:35.083
spar in a way that trains you.

01:41:35.084 --> 01:41:37.424
- Good luck. - Good luck.

01:41:37.824 --> 01:41:40.024
(She judges the situation calmly.)

01:41:40.254 --> 01:41:43.194
(Even when she takes hits, she doesn't give up.)

01:41:43.494 --> 01:41:45.894
(The member with willpower, Determined Sae Rok)

01:41:48.234 --> 01:41:49.303
(She is good at dodging...)

01:41:49.304 --> 01:41:50.633
(and using techniques.)

01:41:50.634 --> 01:41:53.074
(She's a skilled boxer who's good at everything.)

01:41:53.404 --> 01:41:56.174
(The ace member, Simba Seol)

01:41:56.274 --> 01:41:57.374
Round One.

01:41:57.404 --> 01:41:59.473
(A match between two heavy-hitters)

01:41:59.474 --> 01:42:00.543
Box.

01:42:00.544 --> 01:42:01.674
(Round 1 begins.)

01:42:07.454 --> 01:42:08.954
- Oh, my. - There you go.

01:42:09.024 --> 01:42:12.654
(Throwing a cross-counter from the get-go)

01:42:14.424 --> 01:42:16.294
(Sae Rok attempts a straight punch.)

01:42:16.564 --> 01:42:17.693
(In Ah attempts a body shot in retaliation.)

01:42:17.694 --> 01:42:19.464
There you go. Both of you are doing great.

01:42:19.594 --> 01:42:20.734
There you go.

01:42:21.294 --> 01:42:22.334
There you go.

01:42:23.264 --> 01:42:24.464
There you go. Watch carefully.

01:42:24.534 --> 01:42:25.803
(In Ah's straight...)

01:42:25.804 --> 01:42:26.974
(and high-low combination)

01:42:27.174 --> 01:42:29.404
(Sae Rok blocks the punch.)

01:42:29.544 --> 01:42:30.573
(Grunting)

01:42:30.574 --> 01:42:31.944
(Valid body shot)

01:42:33.074 --> 01:42:35.014
(In Ah continues to attempt an attack.)

01:42:35.144 --> 01:42:36.183
(Sae Rok watches In Ah.)

01:42:36.184 --> 01:42:37.314
Sae Rok.

01:42:37.844 --> 01:42:39.284
- There you go. That's good. - Okay.

01:42:40.014 --> 01:42:42.353
(Cross-counter)

01:42:42.354 --> 01:42:44.083
- What a cross-counter. - Good.

01:42:44.084 --> 01:42:46.724
They're like professional boxers. They're professional boxers now.

01:42:46.954 --> 01:42:49.824
(They continue to look for the right time to attack.)

01:42:50.194 --> 01:42:51.593
(A sudden slugfest)

01:42:51.594 --> 01:42:53.264
- Keep going. - There you go.

01:42:53.334 --> 01:42:54.394
(Valid strike)

01:42:55.494 --> 01:42:56.533
(Valid strike)

01:42:56.534 --> 01:42:58.764
(Valid strike)

01:42:58.864 --> 01:43:00.434
There you go. Keep it short.

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:01.573
Keep it short.

01:43:01.574 --> 01:43:03.004
(Sae Rok rushes forward with jabs.)

01:43:03.804 --> 01:43:05.343
Sae Rok, you're doing great.

01:43:05.344 --> 01:43:06.950
(They watch each other's moves with so much intensity.)

01:43:06.974 --> 01:43:08.373
(In Ah tries to get her to punch with a feint.)

01:43:08.374 --> 01:43:09.414
Nice feint.

01:43:12.414 --> 01:43:13.514
There you go.

01:43:13.984 --> 01:43:15.583
Go for a body shot. Jab.

01:43:15.584 --> 01:43:17.354
(After dodging, she lands a valid strike.)

01:43:18.524 --> 01:43:19.853
(Sae Rok pushes her.)

01:43:19.854 --> 01:43:21.224
Don't fall back. There you go.

01:43:21.394 --> 01:43:22.693
(Another cross-counter)

01:43:22.694 --> 01:43:23.723
Don't fall back.

01:43:23.724 --> 01:43:26.494
(As In Ah falls back, Sae Rok attacks.)

01:43:26.534 --> 01:43:28.734
Go to the side.

01:43:29.134 --> 01:43:30.164
There you go.

01:43:31.204 --> 01:43:32.263
You guys are doing great.

01:43:32.264 --> 01:43:34.834
(Sae Rok calmly waits for the right time.)

01:43:35.104 --> 01:43:38.744
(In Ah moves her body to find the find time to attack.)

01:43:39.074 --> 01:43:40.594
They definitely have different styles.

01:43:42.244 --> 01:43:45.243
(In Ah is an infighter with a lot of movements, )

01:43:45.244 --> 01:43:47.030
(and Sae Rok is an outfighter who waits for a big hit.)

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:48.083
(In Ah attempts a body shot with a feint.)

01:43:48.084 --> 01:43:50.154
Go in there. Come on.

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:51.654
There you go. That's good.

01:43:51.984 --> 01:43:53.154
There you go. That's good.

01:43:53.194 --> 01:43:54.754
Keep going until the end.

01:43:54.924 --> 01:43:55.993
That's good. Keep going until the end.

01:43:55.994 --> 01:43:57.023
(Sae Rok corners her.)

01:43:57.024 --> 01:43:58.944
Why are you withdrawing to the back after a hit?

01:43:59.194 --> 01:44:00.664
Go to the side.

01:44:01.034 --> 01:44:02.464
Go to the side. There you go.

01:44:02.904 --> 01:44:05.033
(Jab, one, )

01:44:05.034 --> 01:44:06.533
(two)

01:44:06.534 --> 01:44:10.774
(She throws out punches.)

01:44:12.674 --> 01:44:16.244
(After dodging quickly, she puts up her guard.)

01:44:18.514 --> 01:44:19.684
Sae Rok, you're doing great.

01:44:20.054 --> 01:44:21.153
- Stop. - Okay.

01:44:21.154 --> 01:44:22.553
- Well done. - Nice.

01:44:22.554 --> 01:44:23.624
Come here.

01:44:24.384 --> 01:44:25.554
- They're good. - Well done.

01:44:26.024 --> 01:44:27.424
- They're really good. - Well done.

01:44:27.554 --> 01:44:28.754
- It's fun. - Come over here.

01:44:29.054 --> 01:44:30.664
- Nice. - Well done.

01:44:30.794 --> 01:44:31.963
You guys did great.

01:44:31.964 --> 01:44:33.464
Sae Rok, what you did well was this.

01:44:33.734 --> 01:44:36.734
The way you stayed calm and kept attempting a two was great.

01:44:36.834 --> 01:44:39.203
But you should follow up with a hook after a two.

01:44:39.204 --> 01:44:40.803
Do a hook after a two.

01:44:40.804 --> 01:44:43.243
Otherwise, do a jab after a two. Connect the attacks.

01:44:43.244 --> 01:44:44.443
Then your punches will land.

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:45.473
In Ah,

01:44:45.474 --> 01:44:47.473
your feints and movements were amazing.

01:44:47.474 --> 01:44:49.243
However, after punching,

01:44:49.244 --> 01:44:51.644
you just need to move to the side.

01:44:51.884 --> 01:44:52.983
You keep moving to the back.

01:44:52.984 --> 01:44:54.453
- Okay. - Do you understand?

01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:56.683
After a hit, pivot to the left.

01:44:56.684 --> 01:44:58.353
Then you'll have defense.

01:44:58.354 --> 01:45:00.393
Okay? Your movements are great.

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:02.394
My feet won't listen to me.

01:45:03.324 --> 01:45:05.694
(Her ankle isn't fully recovered.)

01:45:05.764 --> 01:45:07.664
Her punches are so strong.

01:45:08.434 --> 01:45:10.504
Sae Rok, your punches are seriously spicy.

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:11.863
You're the best.

01:45:11.864 --> 01:45:14.173
Hey, your punches are heavy.

01:45:14.174 --> 01:45:16.303
(Speak for yourself.)

01:45:16.304 --> 01:45:17.680
- You guys are doing great. - Seriously.

01:45:17.704 --> 01:45:19.074
Okay. Round Two.

01:45:19.474 --> 01:45:21.013
- Box. - You guys are doing great.

01:45:21.014 --> 01:45:22.174
(Round 2 begins.)

01:45:23.344 --> 01:45:26.214
They're having a serious boxing training.

01:45:26.654 --> 01:45:29.554
(In Ah throws jabs like she did in Round 1.)

01:45:30.254 --> 01:45:31.653
There you go. Keep going until the end.

01:45:31.654 --> 01:45:32.754
Don't move to the back.

01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:35.593
(In Ah's straight comes first.)

01:45:35.594 --> 01:45:37.394
(Then comes a cross-counter.)

01:45:37.624 --> 01:45:39.663
(Sae Rok attacks.)

01:45:39.664 --> 01:45:40.733
(Like her strategy for Round 2)

01:45:40.734 --> 01:45:42.580
(she succeeds in following up with a jab after the one-two!)

01:45:42.604 --> 01:45:43.663
Pivot.

01:45:43.664 --> 01:45:44.704
In Ah, pivot.

01:45:48.434 --> 01:45:50.043
(Readying her footwork)

01:45:50.044 --> 01:45:51.673
Jab, jab, dodge, hook, two.

01:45:51.674 --> 01:45:53.313
There you go. Watch out for it.

01:45:53.314 --> 01:45:55.554
Sae Rok, you're doing great. Sae Rok, use the lead hand.

01:45:55.674 --> 01:45:56.713
There you go.

01:45:56.714 --> 01:45:58.884
(In Ah uses her lead hand aggressively.)

01:45:58.944 --> 01:46:00.254
Sae Rok, do the one-two.

01:46:01.254 --> 01:46:03.423
(Upon hearing Uie, she throws the one-two.)

01:46:03.424 --> 01:46:05.624
(In Ah was cornering Sae Rok with jabs.)

01:46:05.894 --> 01:46:07.553
(A sudden straight)

01:46:07.554 --> 01:46:09.394
(Sae Rok begins to corner In Ah.)

01:46:09.524 --> 01:46:11.723
(Throwing a straight between the jabs)

01:46:11.724 --> 01:46:14.204
(She uses her long reach to make valid strikes with her jabs.)

01:46:14.264 --> 01:46:16.003
(She follows up with a two...)

01:46:16.004 --> 01:46:18.033
(and wraps up with a cross-counter.)

01:46:18.034 --> 01:46:19.034
Go.

01:46:19.035 --> 01:46:21.634
(In Ah pivots to dodge.)

01:46:23.904 --> 01:46:25.803
(After a feint, )

01:46:25.804 --> 01:46:27.943
(she makes a body shot.)

01:46:27.944 --> 01:46:29.613
Connect the attacks until the end.

01:46:29.614 --> 01:46:32.283
Gosh. I can't believe they can do this.

01:46:32.284 --> 01:46:33.714
I can't believe they can do this.

01:46:34.614 --> 01:46:37.884
(The two of them look for the right time to attack.)

01:46:38.584 --> 01:46:39.723
(In Ah closes the gap quickly.)

01:46:39.724 --> 01:46:41.594
There you go. That's good.

01:46:42.454 --> 01:46:45.194
(She went to fight at close range.)

01:46:46.034 --> 01:46:47.593
(Sae Rok lands a jab.)

01:46:47.594 --> 01:46:49.903
(However, In Ah countered with a valid strike.)

01:46:49.904 --> 01:46:52.303
(Cross-counter)

01:46:52.304 --> 01:46:53.874
That's good.

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:55.403
Withdraw.

01:46:55.404 --> 01:46:56.704
Pivot. There you go.

01:46:57.004 --> 01:46:58.443
That's how you withdraw.

01:46:58.444 --> 01:47:00.443
- Sae Rok follows her well. - Sae Rok follows her well.

01:47:00.444 --> 01:47:01.474
That's how you withdraw.

01:47:01.574 --> 01:47:03.183
(Sae Rok follows her again.)

01:47:03.184 --> 01:47:04.643
(She throws a jab.)

01:47:04.644 --> 01:47:05.783
There you go.

01:47:05.784 --> 01:47:07.304
(She lands consecutive valid strikes.)

01:47:07.884 --> 01:47:09.884
Use your lead hand. There you go.

01:47:11.284 --> 01:47:13.294
There you go. That's good.

01:47:13.324 --> 01:47:17.064
(A slugfest begins.)

01:47:17.294 --> 01:47:18.793
(They land a valid strike each.)

01:47:18.794 --> 01:47:19.893
(Hook)

01:47:19.894 --> 01:47:20.934
(Dodging)

01:47:21.764 --> 01:47:22.933
(Sae Rok's valid strike)

01:47:22.934 --> 01:47:25.703
(In Ah's valid strike)

01:47:25.704 --> 01:47:26.733
(Oh, my!)

01:47:26.734 --> 01:47:28.374
Those hooks were very powerful.

01:47:28.434 --> 01:47:30.074
- Cross-counter. - In Ah is so fast.

01:47:30.774 --> 01:47:31.873
(In Ah attacks again, )

01:47:31.874 --> 01:47:32.914
(but Sae Rok dodges.)

01:47:33.214 --> 01:47:36.643
(They attack and defend fiercely.)

01:47:36.644 --> 01:47:38.364
There you go. That's good. Watch carefully.

01:47:38.684 --> 01:47:39.884
Put your guard up.

01:47:40.314 --> 01:47:41.383
- Put your guard up. - Ten seconds.

01:47:41.384 --> 01:47:42.944
Put your lead hand up and get in there.

01:47:43.024 --> 01:47:44.223
Dodge.

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:46.224
(In Ah follows Sae Rok and circles the ring.)

01:47:46.354 --> 01:47:47.923
Good. There you go. Watch the distance.

01:47:47.924 --> 01:47:49.823
Watch the distance. That's it. Watch carefully.

01:47:49.824 --> 01:47:51.194
My goodness. Okay.

01:47:51.364 --> 01:47:52.933
That's it. Watch carefully.

01:47:52.934 --> 01:47:54.633
(In Ah collapses because her ankles give out.)

01:47:54.634 --> 01:47:55.734
Well done.

01:47:56.064 --> 01:47:57.963
Her ankles gave out. Are you okay?

01:47:57.964 --> 01:47:59.433
- I have no strength in them. - Seriously.

01:47:59.434 --> 01:48:00.904
(Worried)

01:48:01.034 --> 01:48:02.603
- I have no strength in them. - Seriously.

01:48:02.604 --> 01:48:03.604
Well done.

01:48:03.605 --> 01:48:04.704
- I'm okay. - Are you okay?

01:48:04.874 --> 01:48:05.874
It's okay.

01:48:05.875 --> 01:48:07.643
(In Ah gave her all to the sparring she hasn't had in a while.)

01:48:07.644 --> 01:48:09.243
I have no strength in my ankles.

01:48:09.244 --> 01:48:10.844
Seriously. I was so startled.

01:48:11.384 --> 01:48:12.914
Both of you guys are amazing.

01:48:14.154 --> 01:48:15.313
I love you.

01:48:15.314 --> 01:48:16.783
(They wrap up with a display of affection.)

01:48:16.784 --> 01:48:18.284
They wrapped up with "I love you."

01:48:18.624 --> 01:48:20.554
- Both of you guys did well. - Sae Rok.

01:48:21.154 --> 01:48:23.093
We can't help but box...

01:48:23.094 --> 01:48:25.293
- as if it's an actual match. - That's right.

01:48:25.294 --> 01:48:26.663
Instinctively...

01:48:26.664 --> 01:48:28.564
We're boxers, so...

01:48:29.734 --> 01:48:30.803
That's right.

01:48:30.804 --> 01:48:31.863
- Are we? - Yes.

01:48:31.864 --> 01:48:33.373
- Yes. - We have that instinct,

01:48:33.374 --> 01:48:35.503
so we can't help but box as if it's an actual match.

01:48:35.504 --> 01:48:36.644
However,

01:48:37.144 --> 01:48:39.374
I got a taste of In Ah's punch for the first time.

01:48:39.674 --> 01:48:41.644
Gosh. The first time,

01:48:41.914 --> 01:48:43.184
when I first got hit...

01:48:43.344 --> 01:48:44.543
(Ringing)

01:48:44.544 --> 01:48:46.454
That's what it felt like.

01:48:46.484 --> 01:48:47.784
(Right at the start of Round 1)

01:48:47.814 --> 01:48:49.494
(they exchanged punches at the same time.)

01:48:49.684 --> 01:48:52.084
(Sae Rok was taken aback by the intensity.)

01:48:52.184 --> 01:48:55.394
Even though her ankle isn't in perfect condition,

01:48:55.694 --> 01:48:57.463
I didn't stand a chance.

01:48:57.464 --> 01:49:00.164
And In Ah threw a hook.

01:49:00.494 --> 01:49:02.263
- It would've been bad if it landed. - Right.

01:49:02.264 --> 01:49:03.534
Thankfully, she missed.

01:49:04.004 --> 01:49:05.433
I still managed to dodge a few.

01:49:05.434 --> 01:49:06.534
- You did. - Yes.

01:49:08.604 --> 01:49:11.003
(Dodge)

01:49:11.004 --> 01:49:13.414
(Dodge again)

01:49:13.944 --> 01:49:16.644
(Sae Rok's evading skills improved.)

01:49:17.044 --> 01:49:18.313
That was fun.

01:49:18.314 --> 01:49:19.384
You did so great.

01:49:19.714 --> 01:49:22.314
I experienced the downsides of getting injured.

01:49:22.354 --> 01:49:24.074
- My ankle won't listen to me. - Of course.

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:25.283
I wanted to pivot,

01:49:25.284 --> 01:49:27.123
but my ankle only moved halfway.

01:49:27.124 --> 01:49:28.854
I thought I turned it.

01:49:29.294 --> 01:49:30.364
It's disappointing.

01:49:30.524 --> 01:49:32.623
I was really surprised, though.

01:49:32.624 --> 01:49:35.264
This is the first time I've seen you spar with each other.

01:49:35.734 --> 01:49:39.034
It's incredible how much growth you've achieved...

01:49:39.364 --> 01:49:40.774
in such a short time.

01:49:40.904 --> 01:49:43.103
You'll win the competition for sure if you keep training like this.

01:49:43.104 --> 01:49:44.143
Yes, that's right.

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:45.620
That was impressive. All four of you.

01:49:45.644 --> 01:49:46.644
- You too. - That was impressive.

01:49:46.645 --> 01:49:47.714
Let's win this thing.

01:49:48.414 --> 01:49:51.343
That was such a valuable training session.

01:49:51.344 --> 01:49:52.443
- We were so cool. - It was great.

01:49:52.444 --> 01:49:53.514
Yes, you were cool.

01:49:53.584 --> 01:49:55.583
The competition is now...

01:49:55.584 --> 01:49:57.423
only ten days away. Right around the corner.

01:49:57.424 --> 01:49:58.900
- It really is. - It's right around the corner.

01:49:58.924 --> 01:50:01.423
So I propose that we go and get some good food.

01:50:01.424 --> 01:50:02.993
- Eating is part of training, right? - Yes, please!

01:50:02.994 --> 01:50:05.223
I haven't heard that in a while. "Eating is part of training."

01:50:05.224 --> 01:50:07.293
- Yes. Eating is part of training. - Give us some protein.

01:50:07.294 --> 01:50:08.963
- Protein. Yes. - Protein.

01:50:08.964 --> 01:50:10.263
You know what's loaded with protein?

01:50:10.264 --> 01:50:11.863
- Barbecue! - Let's go get Korean pork!

01:50:11.864 --> 01:50:13.534
- Gosh. - Gosh!

01:50:13.634 --> 01:50:15.103

01:50:15.104 --> 01:50:16.680
(They head to their final training session.)

01:50:16.704 --> 01:50:20.344
It feels like a classic, old-school restaurant with good food.

01:50:20.874 --> 01:50:22.844
- I'm excited. - I'm starving.

01:50:23.314 --> 01:50:25.043
We'll have the boiled pork.

01:50:25.044 --> 01:50:26.153
All right.

01:50:26.154 --> 01:50:28.783
We'll have the boiled pork. We're starving.

01:50:28.784 --> 01:50:30.754
- Gosh. - Hello.

01:50:31.254 --> 01:50:32.993
(A full-course meal with boiled Korean pork)

01:50:32.994 --> 01:50:34.094

01:50:39.464 --> 01:50:41.994
Nothing beats pork for restoring energy.

01:50:42.094 --> 01:50:44.334
Eating pork is a must after working out.

01:50:44.464 --> 01:50:46.333
This will go so well with the pork.

01:50:46.334 --> 01:50:48.403
- Thank you for the food. - Eat up.

01:50:48.404 --> 01:50:50.003
- Eat up. - Eat up.

01:50:50.004 --> 01:50:51.143
This looks so good.

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:52.914
This is insane.

01:50:53.874 --> 01:50:55.213
- I prefer perilla oil. - I prefer perilla oil too.

01:50:55.214 --> 01:50:56.214
Gosh.

01:50:56.215 --> 01:50:57.444
(Try it.)

01:50:57.584 --> 01:50:59.213
It's so tender.

01:50:59.214 --> 01:51:00.313
Really?

01:51:00.314 --> 01:51:01.684
- Yes. - Boiled pork.

01:51:02.184 --> 01:51:03.454
The umami flavor is...

01:51:03.754 --> 01:51:04.754
- The pork? - Gosh.

01:51:04.755 --> 01:51:05.784
(Gosh!)

01:51:06.354 --> 01:51:07.453
It's so good that it makes me mad.

01:51:07.454 --> 01:51:09.270
(The pork tastes so good that it makes her mad.)

01:51:09.294 --> 01:51:11.023

It's really tender.

01:51:13.564 --> 01:51:14.864
(Gosh!)

01:51:15.234 --> 01:51:16.603
(In awe)

01:51:16.604 --> 01:51:17.934
- It's so good. - Look at that.

01:51:18.134 --> 01:51:20.433
It's so soft and tender. So good.

01:51:20.434 --> 01:51:23.103
What we're eating is Korean pork,

01:51:23.104 --> 01:51:25.073
so we're getting good protein.

01:51:25.074 --> 01:51:26.373
(Nodding in agreement)

01:51:26.374 --> 01:51:27.674
It's so good.

01:51:28.774 --> 01:51:32.584
(Uie puts two pieces in her mouth.)

01:51:33.314 --> 01:51:35.384
(In Ah eats a piece with makguksu.)

01:51:35.854 --> 01:51:37.384
This is great for wrapping the pork.

01:51:40.954 --> 01:51:42.694
Coach, try this. It's really good.

01:51:43.894 --> 01:51:45.093
It's really good, right?

01:51:45.094 --> 01:51:46.434
(Dancing in joy)

01:51:47.394 --> 01:51:48.763
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

01:51:48.764 --> 01:51:50.003
I can't stop eating.

01:51:50.004 --> 01:51:51.910
(Everyone is training their chopsticks skills nonstop.)

01:51:51.934 --> 01:51:53.774
- We ate everything. - We finished everything.

01:51:53.904 --> 01:51:55.003

- Is this real? - These are for you.

01:52:06.914 --> 01:52:09.584

01:52:11.654 --> 01:52:12.924

Well...

01:52:23.964 --> 01:52:28.304
When fighters have about ten days before their competitions,

01:52:28.604 --> 01:52:31.173
they have to eat well, and maintain good physical condition.

01:52:31.174 --> 01:52:32.803
- That's the most important thing. - Yes, sir!

01:52:32.804 --> 01:52:34.073
Maintain good physical condition,

01:52:34.074 --> 01:52:37.043
and promise me to be in your best shape on competition day.

01:52:37.044 --> 01:52:38.083
- Okay. - Okay.

01:52:38.084 --> 01:52:40.153
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

(It's finally the big day.)

01:52:45.366 --> 01:52:48.196
(This time, it's a national competition.)

01:52:48.536 --> 01:52:51.266
(The competition is on a much grander scale.)

01:52:51.966 --> 01:52:54.006
(This is the last boxing match I'll ever fight in.)

01:52:54.036 --> 01:52:55.706
(I want to live without regrets.)

01:52:55.876 --> 01:52:58.346
(This one feels different.)

01:52:58.606 --> 01:53:01.616
(I want to be able to look back and say, "It was really intense.")

01:53:01.876 --> 01:53:04.216
(The Iron Girls...)

01:53:04.246 --> 01:53:06.555
(are prepared and ready to...)

01:53:06.556 --> 01:53:09.016
(fight.)

01:53:09.256 --> 01:53:11.256
(Fighting against their fear, )

01:53:11.986 --> 01:53:18.666
(it's time for them to trust themselves in the ring.)

01:53:18.766 --> 01:53:19.895
(Now, )

01:53:19.896 --> 01:53:21.296
(let's go to the ring.)

01:53:24.736 --> 01:53:28.176
(They have to give it their all.)

01:53:28.706 --> 01:53:31.046
(You have to attack! Sae Rok, go for it!)

01:53:31.406 --> 01:53:34.245
(After today, )

01:53:34.246 --> 01:53:38.286
(there won't be any more opportunities.)

01:53:38.386 --> 01:53:41.185
(Will the Iron Girls...)

01:53:41.186 --> 01:53:45.026
(be able to become champions?)
