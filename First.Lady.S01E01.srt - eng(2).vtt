ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.295
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.156
Miss!

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.613
{\an8}APRIL 2, 2012
9 DAYS UNTIL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.433
Your tie is crooked. Let me see.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.646
I guess I'm not a tie person.

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:29.732
I do it as you taught me,
but this happens every time.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.569
It's always either too long or too short.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.864
Getting the perfect length is hard.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.910
Are you worried about something?

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:43.246
No.

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:45.540
Why do you ask?

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:48.001
It's just strange that
you don't try to stop me.

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:50.795
Is that so?

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:52.630
Well,

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.216
you're supposed to stop
a mere candidate with no rights

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.801
from conducting a negotiation.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.887
Let me see.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.225
Labor negotiations are

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:08.730
much harder than getting a tie
to the perfect length.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.859
Finding a balance between the two is

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:15.403
basically walking on the sharp blade.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:21.200
One side will criticize you
as a hardline unionist,

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:24.162
and the other will call you a traitor,

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:29.042
saying you just side
with your wife's family's company.

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.087
That's why this is strange to me.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:36.090
You insisted on coming with me
instead of stopping me.

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:41.721
I know I can't stop you.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.893
{\an8}If you're going anyway,
I'm coming with you.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:51.814
There.

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.327
Promise me one thing.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.749
If something happens,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.585
think of Ji-yu.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.006
Nothing will happen.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.634
Promise me.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.428
Think of Ji-yu, okay?

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:27.100
Okay.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.524
Only do what you're able to.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:36.943
Don't overdo it.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.614
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.326
Still, be careful.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.789
I said, don't worry.

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:51.708
Everything will be fine.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.470
{\an8}The sit-in by H Chemical workers

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:09.892
protesting mass layoffs
has stretched past three months.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:13.771
After occupying the plant,
the workers are demanding reinstatement.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.803
During talks with the union
occupying the plant,

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:49.932
led by Hyun Min-Cheol, the candidate
of the Participation People's Party,

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.517
a fire broke out.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.603
Six workers were killed,

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.897
and a dozen others were
seriously hurt and hospitalized,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.316
Authorities warn
the death toll could rise.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:11.245
Tragically, candidate Hyun
was left in critical condition

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.956
after attempting
to rescue trapped workers.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.372
Ma'am, you need to stay in bed.

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:55.957
You need to rest.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.959
No.

00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:01.546
Honey!

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.631
Honey.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.300
Hang in there.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.387
- Nurse Kim, stop the bleeding.
- Help!

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.471
Honey!

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:12.557
- Sir.
- Honey!

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.641
Honey!

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.064
Honey.

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:24.277
Honey!

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.821
Honey, wake up.

00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:27.989
Honey.

00:07:28.072 --> 00:07:29.198
Honey.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:36.164
I'm here, so hang in there, okay?

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.499
Excuse me.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.168
Is anyone here?

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.086
Please save this man.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.588
Doctor!

00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:45.214
Is there a doctor here?

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.091
Please save this man!

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:48.843
Doctor! Please!

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:52.388
Hang in there, honey…

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.873
RESTRICTED AREA

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:27.089
{\an8}The operation was successful.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.758
Excuse me.

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:32.428
Thank you.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.680
Thank you.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.145
This is such a relief, ma'am.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:44.023
Thank you so much.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.905
Thank you so much.

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:33.573
Ji-yu, it's you.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:45.269
After two days of surgery,
candidate Hyun Min-Cheol

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:48.022
has survived in a dramatic turn of events.

00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:50.733
However, he sustained
permanent damage to his leg,

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:53.778
raising serious doubts
about his campaign with election day

00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:55.154
now just a week away…

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:58.449
My husband said

00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:02.995
he had to change first
to change the world.

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:07.667
To be honest, I didn't believe that.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.212
Because I've only lived in the world

00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:13.506
where I would only be criticized

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:16.425
for changing alone.

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:21.764
But my husband truly believed it.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:28.437
"One person's change
can change the world."

00:11:29.313 --> 00:11:34.068
{\an8}"Saving one person is saving the world."

00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:38.656
My husband's action
spoke louder than words.

00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:42.410
If you really want to change Haseong,

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:46.872
please cast your valuable vote
for Hyun Min-Cheol.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:49.667
He will certainly change Haseong.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.962
Please send Hyun Min-Cheol
to the National Assembly!

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:56.465
He will change this country!

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.635
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:25.494
{\an8}- Five, four, three, two, one.
- Five, four, three, two, one.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:30.708
{\an8}And now, the results of the exit poll
for the 23rd presidential election.

00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.461
{\an8}Candidate Hyun Min-Cheol, 48.4%.

00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:36.589
{\an8}Candidate Bae Yeong-seon, 47.6%.

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:40.551
{\an8}The two candidates are locked in
a tight race within the margin of error.

00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:43.762
{\an8}Let's go live now to our crew
on the ground to hear from the candidates.

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:47.516
{\an8}Let's bring in Hyun Min-Cheol,
Participation People's Party candidate.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.060
{\an8}PARTICIPATION PEOPLE'S PARTY
HYUN MIN-CHEOL

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:52.897
{\an8}SINCERITY WINS. LET'S CHANGE KOREA!

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.528
{\an8}Candidate Hyun? Is he not ready yet?

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.530
{\an8}Hurry and call him.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.450
{\an8}Looks like we're having some trouble
with the connection.

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:07.328
{\an8}We'll reconnect as soon as it's ready.

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:10.956
Where's Mr. Hyun?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.416
What happened?

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.460
I'm sorry. He wouldn't answer his phone.

00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:18.214
See if he's anywhere in the office.

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.132
And see if anyone saw him leave.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.592
Yes, ma'am.

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:36.148
Then let's bring in Bae Yeong-seon now,
Peace and Freedom Party candidate.

00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:40.110
{\an8}They say elections are
the flower of democracy.

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:45.324
{\an8}Today, that flower is in full bloom.
It's a day of celebration.

00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:47.993
Depending on the results,

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:51.413
I may be elected or defeated,

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.915
but for the people,

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:56.710
regardless of the outcome,
everyone is a winner.

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:59.421
As one team called Korea,

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.007
we're coming together once again.

00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:05.261
This very moment is
a celebration of our unity.

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:28.117
{\an8}1 HOUR 15 MINUTES AGO

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:31.453
ADMITTED ON FEBRUARY 26, 2027
EOM SUN-JEONG, FEMALE

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.972
Sir, where have you been?

00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:17.184
Candidate Hyun, what happened?

00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:19.103
Can we have a brief interview?

00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:20.813
What do you think of the exit poll?

00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:23.023
- Sir, are you okay?
- Why was the speech order changed?

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:24.149
Do you accept the results?

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:57.975
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:23.542
"I have to change first
to change the world."

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:28.672
"One person's change
can change the world."

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:33.886
"Saving one person is saving the world."

00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:39.224
The moment I decided to enter politics,

00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:41.018
I have always proclaimed these.

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:43.062
So now,

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.731
you might be a little sick of them.

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:47.775
Or perhaps,

00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:51.070
they sound too cheesy.

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:53.864
So today,

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:56.533
I'm going to talk about something else.

00:17:56.617 --> 00:17:57.993
Something

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:01.747
a bit more personal.

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:07.669
I was born and raised in Haseong,

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.297
a city famous for its mist.

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.717
People even say

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:15.886
mist is Haseong's specialty.

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:22.017
Mist hides the path ahead,
but never the one behind.

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:24.770
The road we've already traveled

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:27.648
is always clear,
no matter how thick the mist.

00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:29.942
But the road ahead,

00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:34.613
no matter how near,
remains hidden from view.

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:37.783
Though I've seen mist
countless times since childhood,

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.327
it has always filled me with fear.

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:43.205
Because when walking through the fog,

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:48.043
the faces that were just beside me
suddenly disappear.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:51.380
The faces of the people

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:54.299
who were walking by my side,

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:56.218
holding my hands.

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:08.313
Before I could even come of age,
I lost my parents.

00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:10.941
Then after coming of age,

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:15.654
I had to part ways with my friends
I grew up with at the orphanage.

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:20.993
The person I dated for seven years
since I was 20,

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:25.956
vanished into the fog without a word.

00:19:28.208 --> 00:19:29.042
That's how

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.171
everybody left me.

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:37.843
Except for one person.

00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:40.679
Only one person

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.849
didn't leave me.

00:19:46.101 --> 00:19:48.854
She's always by my side,

00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:51.190
saying that she's here for me.

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:53.775
That person

00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:57.905
gave me the home I have never had,

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.991
and the precious family

00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:04.870
that I could only dream of.

00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:07.998
So I'm always sorry.

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:12.753
She says it's not sorry but thankful,

00:20:12.836 --> 00:20:15.714
that I confuse the two.

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:19.384
But still, I'm sorry.

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.804
She has quietly endured the hardships

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:27.059
she would never have faced,
had I not entered politics.

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.436
And if I were to say this aloud,

00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:31.939
I know she would say it again

00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:37.486
that it's not sorry but grateful.

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.823
I'm sincerely grateful.

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:44.952
Thanks to you,

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:48.288
I am where I am today.

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:51.667
CANDIDATE HYUN
CREDITS HIS WIFE FOR SUPPORT

00:20:58.131 --> 00:20:59.591
Here today,

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:03.136
{\an8}I make a formal proposal
to Candidate Bae Yeong-seon.

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.682
Please join me
in passing the Do Tae-hoon Act,

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:10.352
a special bill
on the H Chemical fire and public safety,

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:15.399
which has been discarded dozens of times

00:21:15.482 --> 00:21:19.069
and pending in the Assembly for 15 years.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.950
Regardless of the election results,
if we join forces,

00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:27.077
we can pass this bill.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.538
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Candidate Bae.

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:31.707
On the day
the flower of democracy is in full bloom,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.959
please join me in passing the special act

00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:36.712
so that our people can live

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.340
happy, and most importantly, secure lives.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.176
Some might ask

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.804
why today, of all days.

00:21:45.887 --> 00:21:47.222
That's because

00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:50.434
I lost another person

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:53.395
in the fog.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.315
And seeing that person,

00:21:57.524 --> 00:21:59.526
I realized why I entered politics

00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:04.364
and why I wanted to become
a president in the first place.

00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:05.907
Some might ask

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.786
why I'm still hung up
on what happened 15 years ago.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.371
That's because

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:14.249
people who shouldn't have died, died.

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:17.794
Because there are victims
who were framed as perpetrators.

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:20.047
Too many people have died,

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.009
and there are too many unjust stories.

00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:29.389
Because each and every one
of those deaths becomes a nail

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:34.311
that pierces the wound every spring,

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.814
turning April into a season

00:22:39.232 --> 00:22:41.943
too painful to endure.

00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:47.657
"I have to change first

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.202
to change the world."

00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:52.662
"One person's change

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:55.332
can change the world."

00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:58.418
"Saving one person

00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:00.712
is saving the world."

00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:03.590
Because

00:23:04.674 --> 00:23:06.593
each and every one of them

00:23:08.428 --> 00:23:10.305
is the world.

00:23:29.825 --> 00:23:35.872
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

00:23:37.707 --> 00:23:40.669
{\an8}- Cha Su-yeon!
- Cha Su-yeon!

00:23:50.554 --> 00:23:52.973
Live election coverage?
No need to watch it.

00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:55.517
It's already been decided.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.979
{\an8}Who wins?
Of course, Hyun Min-Cheol, the Iron Man.

00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:05.443
I kept saying HWA, remember?

00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:08.697
HWA means "Hyun Wins Anyway."

00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:11.908
Elections are scientific.

00:24:13.326 --> 00:24:17.164
What I'm saying now is scientific.

00:24:17.247 --> 00:24:20.041
I'm not wondering
whether Hyun Min-Cheol wins or not.

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.419
He's already won!

00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:24.421
You'll see.

00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:32.012
Right now, I'm more interested in

00:24:32.095 --> 00:24:34.055
the Iron Lady, Ms. Cha.

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:36.433
I wonder what our lovely Ms. Cha's

00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:38.810
outfit is going to be like today.

00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:42.898
I want to know
how her OOTD will catch our eyes.

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:44.983
All right.

00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:46.985
Let's see.

00:24:50.238 --> 00:24:51.448
Remember this time?

00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:53.200
You saw this, right?

00:24:53.283 --> 00:24:55.785
I already knew it,
but I really look just like her.

00:24:56.286 --> 00:24:57.120
See?

00:24:57.204 --> 00:25:00.290
Look at all these clothes,
jewelry, and bags.

00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:02.709
Everything Ms. Cha wore is sold out.

00:25:02.792 --> 00:25:06.046
Some people say
this is the old money style, but…

00:25:07.964 --> 00:25:10.759
You're right. It's silver spoon style.

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:12.219
Diamond spoon style.

00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:14.679
Today will be the highlight.

00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:17.307
It's the finale.

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.685
This is what I'm dying to know now.

00:25:20.977 --> 00:25:23.271
SILK_CHOI
300,000 WON, I SUPPORT YOU!

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:26.691
Oh, my! Thank you, "SILK_Choi!"

00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:29.611
I wish you a silky day today.

00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:31.196
Thank you.

00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:33.990
{\an8}Oh, boy. You didn't have to donate.

00:25:34.074 --> 00:25:35.033
{\an8}But thank you.

00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:36.618
Yes!

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.329
Yes, we're going to have an order rush.

00:25:39.412 --> 00:25:42.874
We'll place the order in 30 minutes,
so hang tight.

00:25:43.416 --> 00:25:46.461
Come on. This is not the time
to complain about being overworked.

00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:49.214
We've got to make hay
while the sun shines.

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:53.635
Fine. Just make sure
we hit a new sales record.

00:25:53.718 --> 00:25:55.470
Then I'll give you a bonus,

00:25:55.553 --> 00:25:57.931
and an oversea vacation on top of that!

00:25:58.014 --> 00:25:59.849
Where do you want to go? Guam? Maldives?

00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:01.601
How about Hawaii…

00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:05.897
Sorry.

00:26:07.107 --> 00:26:08.692
Today is an important day.

00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:09.943
Focus.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.195
Geez.

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:13.905
Sure. Anything you want.

00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:48.106
What are you doing? Come on.

00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:50.442
Gosh.

00:26:51.609 --> 00:26:55.071
Oh, my!
You just get prettier and prettier, Ji-yu.

00:26:55.155 --> 00:26:59.075
You look just like Ms. Cha.

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:04.998
The navy jacket over there.

00:27:05.081 --> 00:27:08.043
It's a gift to celebrate starting school.

00:27:08.126 --> 00:27:11.171
It's the jacket that went viral
after Jenny wore it at the airport.

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:14.466
I thought it'd suit you perfectly,

00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:17.510
so I brought it all the way from Paris.

00:27:17.594 --> 00:27:18.970
It's a limited edition.

00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:20.055
Do you want to try it on?

00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:22.015
Later.

00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:24.184
Sure.

00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:28.188
Ms. Cha is waiting. Hurry up.

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:29.934
{\an8}Excellent choice.

00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:33.438
White is the best color
for a fresh start for sure.

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.408
Oh, my.

00:29:46.075 --> 00:29:48.995
You look gorgeous in white.

00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:54.083
It fits you perfectly.

00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:57.879
The shoes are over there.

00:30:04.594 --> 00:30:07.472
I picked out the pairs
that would go well with this outfit.

00:30:07.555 --> 00:30:11.309
And all of them are new collections
that haven't been released in Korea yet.

00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:19.442
How about these?

00:30:19.526 --> 00:30:22.946
They were very well received
at this year's haute couture shows.

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:58.356
Aren't they a little old-fashioned?

00:30:58.439 --> 00:31:01.901
Nothing beats the classics!

00:31:01.985 --> 00:31:05.238
Real luxury isn't about following trends,

00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:06.823
but about setting them.

00:31:06.906 --> 00:31:10.410
You have such a great eye.

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:14.747
It's perfect for a special day like today.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.750
My gosh. That's just perfect.

00:31:21.337 --> 00:31:24.257
All right. Hyun Min-Cheol
of the Participation People's Party

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.803
has been confirmed as the 23rd president
of the Republic of Korea.

00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:35.935
Beginning as a poor factory worker,

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:39.105
Hyun Min-Cheol has overcome
disability and prejudice.

00:31:39.188 --> 00:31:41.816
{\an8}And now, he has risen
to become the president of South Korea!

00:31:46.863 --> 00:31:48.364
- We won!
- We won!

00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:51.576
Sincerity wins!

00:31:51.659 --> 00:31:54.162
- Let's change Korea!
- Let's change Korea!

00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:56.581
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

00:31:56.664 --> 00:31:59.375
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Sir.

00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:34.744
My goodness. Congratulations, madam!

00:32:34.827 --> 00:32:37.413
No, I shouldn't call you that anymore.

00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:40.541
First Lady, congratulations.

00:33:03.773 --> 00:33:06.234
Red suits you.

00:33:07.527 --> 00:33:08.361
Pardon?

00:33:09.362 --> 00:33:10.196
Your lipstick.

00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:15.868
What are you doing? Give it to her now.

00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:17.161
Okay.

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:24.127
Let me know if you like the color.
I'll get it ready for you.

00:33:36.723 --> 00:33:38.641
It doesn't suit me.

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:44.397
I guess it looks good on people
with soft and innocent faces like you.

00:33:44.981 --> 00:33:46.357
I'm sorry.

00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:49.986
You should keep your hands

00:33:51.487 --> 00:33:53.031
off someone else's stuff.

00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:12.425
My goodness.

00:34:26.689 --> 00:34:28.316
Whether it's an object

00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:31.319
or a person.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.658
- Cha Su-yeon!
- Cha Su-yeon!

00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:47.251
How do you feel about
becoming the First Lady?

00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:48.711
Ms. Cha Su-yeon!

00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:51.339
How do you feel about
becoming the First Lady?

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.218
Cha Su-yeon is the best!

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.524
Follow the front car, please.

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:15.863
Hello.

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.449
Did I guess our dearest Madam Cha,

00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:20.034
no,

00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:24.038
the First Lady's outfit correctly
yet again today?

00:35:24.914 --> 00:35:26.124
I guessed right!

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:30.211
The key points of Madam Cha's outfit today

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:33.923
are her nude-toned lipstick
and natural hairstyle.

00:35:35.758 --> 00:35:38.344
She dressed formally without overdoing it.

00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:40.596
{\an8}It's perfect for the occasion!

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.475
{\an8}A white suit looks a bit formal,

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:46.853
but it's a very stylish look,

00:35:47.436 --> 00:35:49.397
so it makes you glow.

00:35:55.027 --> 00:35:56.946
Thank you!

00:35:57.947 --> 00:36:00.950
I'm a hot issue from head to toe

00:36:01.033 --> 00:36:03.953
Everything about me becomes a hot issue

00:36:04.036 --> 00:36:06.038
Everyone, take control

00:36:14.714 --> 00:36:16.674
What did I tell you?

00:36:16.757 --> 00:36:18.759
I said we'd break our sales record.

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.762
Make sure that no size is sold out.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.431
Accept every order.

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:26.726
I'll do whatever it takes to stock up.

00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:27.643
Okay.

00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:30.563
What is it?

00:36:30.646 --> 00:36:31.731
I'm sorry.

00:36:31.814 --> 00:36:32.982
Sorry about what?

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:35.818
I left my phone at home.

00:36:35.902 --> 00:36:37.028
Gosh, you…

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:38.696
I'm hanging up.

00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:42.700
Why on earth are you so distracted?

00:36:42.783 --> 00:36:45.328
We need every second
to earn as much as we can!

00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:48.497
Go ahead first. I'll catch up soon.

00:36:49.957 --> 00:36:51.167
Oh, speaking of which.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.961
What was that with Madam just now?

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:55.630
You glared daggers at her!

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:57.882
How dare you act up in front of her?

00:36:57.965 --> 00:36:59.884
You better not do that again.

00:36:59.967 --> 00:37:01.093
I'm sorry.

00:37:01.177 --> 00:37:02.511
Why are you still here?

00:37:02.595 --> 00:37:04.180
I said we needed every second.

00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:06.682
Seriously.

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:33.042
The wife of the president-elect,

00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:36.879
Cha Su-yeon, is heading to Haseong Yard.

00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:43.344
Madam Cha led a powerful fanbase
centered around her fan club, Iron Lady,

00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:47.556
which has a million fans, and contributed
to the victory of the election.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.933
Cha Su-yeon!

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:51.143
President-elect Hyun and Madam Cha Su-yeon

00:37:51.227 --> 00:37:54.146
will give a victory speech in Haseong,

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.566
where their political base started from.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:00.611
Haseong Yard already has
Cha's numerous fans

00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:04.699
and the president-elect's supporters
waiting for the two.

00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:08.577
The Yard is filled with excitement
and heat which resembles that

00:38:08.661 --> 00:38:10.413
of a concert.

00:38:32.184 --> 00:38:34.895
{\an8}CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
HASEONG HIGH SCHOOL ADMISSION IN 2027

00:38:41.944 --> 00:38:46.157
Just like new sprouts that grow fresh
on a mountain after it rains, I hope

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.408
my fellow students

00:38:47.491 --> 00:38:50.661
will overcome any hardships and obstacles.

00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:53.497
I sincerely wish
for your tremendous success

00:38:53.581 --> 00:38:54.874
when you step into society.

00:38:54.957 --> 00:38:57.251
You must be happy

00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:59.462
to have such a brilliant son.

00:38:59.545 --> 00:39:02.006
He's good at both studies and sports.

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:03.591
That's not it.

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:05.634
He's handsome and tall.

00:39:05.718 --> 00:39:07.970
He could outshine most idol singers.

00:39:08.804 --> 00:39:11.432
Would he be satisfied with being an idol?

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:14.310
He could easily become a doctor
or study law.

00:39:15.227 --> 00:39:18.814
It must be fun to support Gang Myeong.

00:39:19.482 --> 00:39:21.108
Stop it.

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.943
I'm jealous, that's all.

00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:27.573
It's Cha Su-yeon.

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:30.076
The winner is Hyun.

00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:31.702
The winner is Hyun.

00:39:31.786 --> 00:39:34.455
- The winner is Hyun.
- The winner is Hyun.

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:37.249
- The winner is Hyun.
- Enough, be quiet.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.295
Why did you come? You must be busy.

00:39:42.171 --> 00:39:44.507
My family voted in advance yesterday.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.175
Thank you.

00:39:46.258 --> 00:39:48.719
You've become prettier in the meantime.

00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:51.597
Look at your skin. It's so firm.

00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:54.517
Take good care of my child.

00:39:55.101 --> 00:39:57.228
Come on, Ji-yu is a freshman too.

00:39:58.145 --> 00:40:01.315
Seriously though, why did you come?
The election is tomorrow.

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:04.193
You're here.

00:40:06.779 --> 00:40:08.697
You should've told us beforehand.

00:40:08.781 --> 00:40:10.241
I didn't know either.

00:40:10.324 --> 00:40:13.119
Can we take a photo?

00:40:13.202 --> 00:40:14.995
I'm a huge fan of yours.

00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:21.043
Let us take a photo together, too.

00:40:22.044 --> 00:40:23.921
- Shall we all take one together?
- Really?

00:40:24.004 --> 00:40:25.297
Shall we?

00:40:25.381 --> 00:40:28.175
If I'd known beforehand,
I would've done my hair.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.510
Secretary Shin, join us.

00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:31.262
No, I'll take a photo of you.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.264
Okay.

00:40:45.317 --> 00:40:47.194
Didn't you say you couldn't make time?

00:40:48.237 --> 00:40:49.196
Yes.

00:40:49.822 --> 00:40:51.198
See you later.

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:54.660
The freshmen representatives
will swear an oath.

00:40:54.743 --> 00:40:58.998
Class 2 of Year 1,
Hyun Ji Yu and An Gang Myeong.

00:40:59.081 --> 00:41:00.291
Come here.

00:41:06.213 --> 00:41:07.798
{\an8}- We swear.
- We swear.

00:41:07.882 --> 00:41:11.552
{\an8}We freshmen will respect
our friends and teachers.

00:41:11.635 --> 00:41:13.721
- With genuine…
- Who would you pick?

00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:17.099
A mom who neglects
her daughter's entrance ceremony

00:41:17.183 --> 00:41:19.143
because tomorrow is the election day?

00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:21.270
Or a mom who attends the ceremony

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.230
despite the election being tomorrow?

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:26.358
You should've told me in advance.

00:41:26.442 --> 00:41:27.985
I could've fetched you.

00:41:28.068 --> 00:41:29.403
I thought you'd be busy.

00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:36.202
{\an8}I forgot how devoted you are to your son.

00:41:37.578 --> 00:41:38.787
Where's my husband?

00:41:39.246 --> 00:41:40.998
An interview with a broadcaster.

00:41:41.081 --> 00:41:43.292
Secretary Lee is assisting him.

00:41:44.543 --> 00:41:45.836
Last Friday.

00:41:47.296 --> 00:41:50.925
He suddenly called off a schedule,
and I asked you to find out why.

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:53.844
Everything was fine until the morning.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:59.350
You've yet to find out? Or you refuse to?

00:42:03.604 --> 00:42:04.647
I apologize.

00:42:05.898 --> 00:42:07.107
That means you refuse to.

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:11.153
We'll do our very best
to secure the environment

00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:13.322
where students can focus on their studies.

00:42:13.405 --> 00:42:14.740
Thank you.

00:42:25.793 --> 00:42:27.753
Your timing was off just now.

00:42:27.836 --> 00:42:29.713
{\an8}I was right. It was two seconds.

00:42:29.797 --> 00:42:31.048
{\an8}Mine was two seconds.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.510
{\an8}You said you were nervous. I guess not.

00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:36.387
{\an8}Whatever.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.556
{\an8}- It's cold. Let's go in.
- Yes.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:58.951
Congratulations.

00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:07.543
Ji-yu.

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.462
It's my entrance ceremony.

00:43:13.048 --> 00:43:14.842
Not where you run your campaign.

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.260
Just for today.

00:43:17.344 --> 00:43:18.596
Congratulations.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.558
Must you go this far?

00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:23.767
You look pretty.

00:43:24.393 --> 00:43:25.269
Smile.

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:35.446
I want to go study overseas.

00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:40.159
Study overseas out of the blue?

00:43:40.242 --> 00:43:42.870
I passed a ballet school audition.

00:43:43.912 --> 00:43:45.748
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

00:43:45.831 --> 00:43:47.416
You never brought it up.

00:43:47.499 --> 00:43:49.084
Weren't you going to stop me anyway?

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:53.213
You stop me every time saying
it disrupts the election.

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:56.550
No competitions, no arts high school.

00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:57.468
That's not--

00:43:57.551 --> 00:43:59.219
Even now, look.

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:02.765
Instead of congratulating me
or asking which school it is,

00:44:02.848 --> 00:44:06.268
you scold me
for not telling you in advance first.

00:44:10.898 --> 00:44:12.399
Tomorrow is the election.

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:13.942
We can talk after that.

00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:16.111
Election, election, election!

00:44:17.696 --> 00:44:18.656
Can you stop?

00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:20.282
I have no choice.

00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:23.577
Everything will change after tomorrow.

00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:25.913
Everything changes for you.

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:28.332
The election result doesn't concern me.

00:44:28.415 --> 00:44:29.625
Ji-yu.

00:44:35.047 --> 00:44:36.590
I'll go after the election.

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:38.133
Are you happy?

00:44:38.634 --> 00:44:40.302
- That's not it.
- What now?

00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:45.349
Nothing matters after the election.

00:44:45.432 --> 00:44:46.809
Whether I go overseas or not.

00:44:48.143 --> 00:44:49.728
I can live however I want, right?

00:44:49.812 --> 00:44:51.522
I don't have to see Dad anymore, right?

00:44:54.024 --> 00:44:55.609
"Don't have to see Dad anymore?"

00:44:57.277 --> 00:45:00.030
Aren't you going overseas to study?

00:45:00.114 --> 00:45:02.825
Aren't you going overseas to do ballet?

00:45:03.742 --> 00:45:07.746
Why would you go so far as to
study overseas just to avoid your dad?

00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:10.874
Why?

00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:12.334
It's none of your business.

00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:14.420
Just leave me alone.

00:45:16.672 --> 00:45:18.090
Look at me and talk.

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:20.926
I said, look at me!

00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:28.600
It's all bullshit.

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:31.895
What?

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:48.162
What did you just say?

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:51.039
Hyun Ji-yu.

00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:53.333
Look me in the eyes and say that again!

00:45:56.712 --> 00:45:58.380
It's all bullshit.

00:45:58.881 --> 00:46:01.717
Sincerity and whatnot,
those words are all bullshit.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.428
Both you and Dad.

00:46:04.511 --> 00:46:06.013
It's all bullshit!

00:46:16.857 --> 00:46:18.442
Dad…

00:46:20.736 --> 00:46:21.945
is seeing a woman.

00:46:25.365 --> 00:46:26.825
I saw it.

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.011
Besides you,

00:46:46.595 --> 00:46:47.804
has anyone seen it?

00:46:51.016 --> 00:46:53.560
- What?
- Who else did you tell?

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:56.146
Friends? Teachers?

00:47:00.108 --> 00:47:02.653
This is important. Answer me.

00:47:03.278 --> 00:47:05.197
Did anyone else see it?

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.407
Who else did you tell?

00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:10.661
Don't tell me…

00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:14.957
You knew?

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.500
Answer me.

00:47:16.583 --> 00:47:17.626
No one else saw it?

00:47:17.709 --> 00:47:19.086
Am I the only one you told?

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:21.672
We're the only ones who know, right?

00:47:22.881 --> 00:47:24.341
You knew.

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:27.636
You knew, didn't you?

00:47:27.719 --> 00:47:28.762
Since when?

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:29.846
That's important?

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.099
Dad is seeing a woman.

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:34.226
Dad is cheating on you.

00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:35.769
How is this not important?

00:47:37.813 --> 00:47:39.606
That's his right to privacy.

00:47:40.983 --> 00:47:42.317
Privacy?

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:45.153
Aren't you two married?

00:47:45.237 --> 00:47:46.154
Even if we are--

00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:48.282
You knew, but you still live with him?

00:47:49.157 --> 00:47:50.033
Why?

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:52.786
Just why?

00:47:53.412 --> 00:47:55.747
For what? For whom?

00:47:55.831 --> 00:47:57.249
You and I.

00:47:58.083 --> 00:48:00.294
We're the only ones
who know about this, right?

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:05.090
Then keep this between us.

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:08.093
The word cannot leak out.

00:48:08.176 --> 00:48:10.262
What you've said has never happened.

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:11.555
Promise me.

00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:13.056
Mom.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.976
Once this leaks out,
it won't end with his private life.

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:18.478
It won't end just as our family matter.

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:21.690
It'll come back to us
with consequences we can never bear.

00:48:22.941 --> 00:48:24.359
So promise me.

00:48:24.443 --> 00:48:25.777
Promise?

00:48:26.862 --> 00:48:29.489
Isn't a promise between a couple
a promise too?

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:31.158
What about a promise between family?

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:33.076
Hyun Ji-yu, promise me.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.203
Dad is the one
who broke the promise first!

00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:49.509
I'm begging you.

00:48:50.677 --> 00:48:52.304
Just forget it.

00:48:53.096 --> 00:48:55.515
What you saw and heard that day.

00:48:56.183 --> 00:48:57.434
Forget all about it.

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:01.480
You're amazing!

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:04.274
Why are you going this far?

00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:07.194
President? First Lady?

00:49:07.736 --> 00:49:09.696
Are those so important?

00:49:14.868 --> 00:49:16.578
Think however you like.

00:49:17.537 --> 00:49:19.998
I've erased it from my memory already.

00:49:20.082 --> 00:49:21.416
Mom!

00:49:28.006 --> 00:49:29.007
I'll start driving.

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:57.369
It's Cha Su-yeon!

00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:09.756
- Cha Su-yeon!
- Cha Su-yeon!

00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:32.279
The First Lady,

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.489
Cha Su-yeon, is making her entrance.

00:50:49.171 --> 00:50:51.840
- Cha Su-yeon!
- Cha Su-yeon!

00:51:06.646 --> 00:51:07.689
Thank you.

00:51:08.482 --> 00:51:09.900
Thank you.

00:51:10.942 --> 00:51:12.027
Thank you.

00:51:13.528 --> 00:51:14.488
Thank you.

00:51:17.032 --> 00:51:18.158
Thank you.

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:19.993
Thank you.

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:24.956
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

00:51:54.694 --> 00:51:58.156
President-elect Hyun Min-Cheol
is making his entrance.

00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:03.328
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:01.386
The result is out.
My house's in an uproar.

00:53:01.469 --> 00:53:02.387
It was insane.

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:04.598
Should we call Ji-yu a princess now?

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:06.850
It's Young Lady, not Princess.

00:53:06.933 --> 00:53:08.852
Why is the heroine so quiet?

00:53:08.935 --> 00:53:11.479
She doesn't want
to text us lower class people now.

00:53:11.563 --> 00:53:13.231
She won't sit with us anymore.

00:53:13.773 --> 00:53:15.025
Should we test her food first?

00:53:15.108 --> 00:53:16.693
She already has a food taster.

00:53:17.235 --> 00:53:18.862
- Who?
- An Gang-myeong's mom.

00:53:18.945 --> 00:53:21.948
Right, she can come to school
to work starting tomorrow.

00:53:56.149 --> 00:53:58.485
Please look at the display board.

00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:46.700
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

00:55:07.554 --> 00:55:08.430
Here.

00:55:20.358 --> 00:55:22.110
Don't try too hard.

00:55:22.193 --> 00:55:23.945
You'll get tired easily.

00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:27.532
Do you know what's funny?

00:55:27.615 --> 00:55:29.576
If you say, "Let's stop here today,"

00:55:30.118 --> 00:55:31.161
you can continue again.

00:55:47.218 --> 00:55:48.470
You can do it.

00:55:50.722 --> 00:55:51.931
I believe in you.

00:55:52.974 --> 00:55:55.185
I believe you can stand

00:55:55.268 --> 00:55:56.853
and walk again.

00:55:58.688 --> 00:56:01.608
Others might not, but I believe in you.

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:05.028
So you should believe it too.

00:56:09.949 --> 00:56:11.076
That's it.

00:56:11.743 --> 00:56:13.536
Honey, straighten your shoulders.

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.497
Yes. Don't look down.

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:17.165
Look at me and walk. Yes.

00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:18.917
You're almost there.

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.715
I told you that you could do it.

00:56:26.424 --> 00:56:28.676
Walk to where I am.

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.720
One more step. Yes.

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:32.847
One more step.

00:56:33.973 --> 00:56:35.225
Just one more step.

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:37.769
Honey!

00:56:40.522 --> 00:56:43.233
You did well. You did well.

00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:48.696
You did well.

00:56:52.158 --> 00:56:54.119
Honey, you're almost there.

00:56:54.202 --> 00:56:56.454
You're almost there. Good job.

00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:00.125
Do you want a break?

00:57:01.334 --> 00:57:02.502
Five minutes.

00:57:03.169 --> 00:57:04.629
No, just one minute.

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:22.439
{\an8}I told you that you could do it.

00:57:23.857 --> 00:57:27.110
{\an8}You're here. You're really here.

00:57:27.902 --> 00:57:29.612
We did it.

00:57:47.046 --> 00:57:48.506
Traitor!

00:57:56.931 --> 00:57:57.932
Let me go!

00:58:01.102 --> 00:58:02.604
Sincerity? What nonsense.

00:58:02.687 --> 00:58:04.939
Everything was a lie!

00:58:05.023 --> 00:58:06.232
You murderer!

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.446
You guys killed him.

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:13.573
Tae-hoon.

00:58:14.199 --> 00:58:16.034
You two killed him!

00:58:19.913 --> 00:58:21.414
Are you okay?

00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:23.333
What about my husband?

00:58:24.876 --> 00:58:26.377
He's safe.

00:58:54.405 --> 00:58:55.490
Are you happy?

00:58:56.115 --> 00:58:57.158
Are you?

00:58:58.034 --> 00:58:59.536
You killed Tae-hoon,

00:59:00.495 --> 00:59:04.415
and now you've become a president.
Are you over the moon?

00:59:06.167 --> 00:59:07.460
Do Tae-hoon Law?

00:59:08.086 --> 00:59:11.965
Must you make use of his death too?

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.469
You guys make me sick.

00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:18.680
It's disgusting.

00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:24.602
Just you watch.

00:59:24.686 --> 00:59:26.229
I won't let your sacrifice

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.856
go to waste.

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:31.734
Sacrifice?

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:36.489
It's sacrifice
only if one chooses for oneself.

00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:38.199
He didn't sacrifice himself.

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.785
You killed him.

00:59:40.868 --> 00:59:42.495
{\an8}You killed him!

00:59:45.164 --> 00:59:47.083
What are you doing? Drag him out!

00:59:47.166 --> 00:59:50.253
I'll make you pay for Tae-hoon's death!

00:59:51.129 --> 00:59:52.630
I'll risk my life to make you pay!

00:59:52.714 --> 00:59:54.048
And you two!

00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:56.551
I'll make sure to drag you down!

00:59:57.302 --> 00:59:59.804
I'll drag you down no matter what!

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:23.828
Thank you.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:27.915
Eun Bo-ra.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.546
Cha Su-yeon!

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.883
- Cha Su-yeon!
- Cha Su-yeon!

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:03.076
- Hyun Min-cheol!
- Hyun Min-cheol!

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:06.788
- Cha Su-yeon! Hyun Min-cheol!
- Cha Su-yeon! Hyun Min-cheol!

01:01:58.589 --> 01:02:01.592
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:01.277
Let's get divorced.

01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:06.491
What?

01:03:07.366 --> 01:03:08.618
Let's divorce.

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.793
{\an8}There was a car accident on February 26.

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.837
{\an8}It was a hit and run.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.964
{\an8}Find out if there's a witness.

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:06.676
{\an8}What will change if the truth
about the fire comes out?

01:04:06.759 --> 01:04:08.427
{\an8}There's nothing you can change.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.762
{\an8}I saw it.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:12.765
{\an8}I saw you two together that day.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:16.102
{\an8}It's divorce. Use that exact word.

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:18.062
{\an8}I'll end it.

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:23.359
{\an8}I made the choice,
so I should do it my way.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.362
