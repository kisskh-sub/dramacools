let's fight our way out
of here together.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.159
Just like when we did
in the Nine Heavens.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:54.799
I don't believe

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.480
there is no place for us

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.319
in the Three Realms.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.040
Let's go.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.800
Chase them!

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.819
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.520
Let's get out!

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.759
Why looking at me like that?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.000
You once said

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.000
you loved me.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:54.960
Was that in my past life?

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:58.520
How did you know?

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.000
You said before,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.199
300 years ago,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.840
your hope was shattered.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.159
You once

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.360
killed me, right?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.120
I wanted

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.719
to follow you in death.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.400
The Immortal Lord told me
you'd reappear after 300 years later.

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:39.639
I never expected

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.479
the Night Deity would
revive within you too.

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.520
Can't we

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.120
change our fates?

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.840
300 years without you

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.919
was far too long.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.944
Yet I don't want to kill you again
after 300 years.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.599
Chuli.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.040
I've decided

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.519
to die with you.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.680
Then we'll never be apart again.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.879
No, Chen.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.720
You must live well.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.319
Do you know?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.319
If every 300 years,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.680
I'm meant to be killed by someone,

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.079
and then I'd rather it is you.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:38.759
Chuli.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.279
When I revive after 300 years,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.839
and you're gone,

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:44.879
what should I do?

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.000
Where would I go look for you?

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.040
You have to live well,

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:54.560
so we can meet again.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:55.680
No.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.040
Swear to me

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.680
that you'll live well

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.899
and never abandon your life for me.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.519
Why?

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:11.319
That's too cruel to me.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.160
This is my wish.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.560
Can't you grant me even this?

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:28.360
Alright.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.720
I promise.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.720
Good.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.959
If you break this,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.920
I will be reduced to ashes

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.319
and never reincarnate.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.480
Chuli.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.839
Don't do this to me.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.920
I'm selfish and domineering.

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.439
I just want you to live well.

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.120
That way every time I revive,

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.000
I can meet you again.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.240
Okay.

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:18.279
In that case,

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.120
go reclaim the Divine Sword.

00:06:26.432 --> 00:06:29.344
(Falling Snow)

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:04.079
What's wrong?

00:07:04.928 --> 00:07:05.728
What's on your mind?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.959
Nothing.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.360
I was just thinking

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.680
if possible, I'd like to die
in the sea of flowers.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:17.079
Don't say that!

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.800
I won't let you die.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.920
I mean, if...

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.959
No way!

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.079
Pity

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:33.680
that my blood makes flowers wither.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.800
Pretty?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.240
Chuli.

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:11.839
Chuli.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.660
How are you?

00:08:14.495 --> 00:08:15.040
How are you?

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:16.100
Answer me.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.800
Answer me.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.360
I'm here.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.560
I'm here.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.399
Kill me.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.720
Please.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.439
I won't kill you.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.040
Please.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.519
Kill me.

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:33.240
I don't want to be like this anymore.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.960
Wake up.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.159
Chuli.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.000
It seems

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:28.120
you still remember our promise.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.299
I remember.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.240
Take up your sword

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.480
and point it at me.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.080
You're the War God of Nine Heavens.

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:44.879
Only in this way

00:10:46.784 --> 00:10:49.960
will Night Deity stop controlling me
and endangering the Three Realms.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.000
Do it now.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.360
While I'm still myself.

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:17.919
I want to be

She requests to meet you,

Leave.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.100

00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:55.419
Don't be that arrogant.

00:15:55.419 --> 00:15:55.860
Stop!

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.700
Sir.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.820
This matter isn't yours to refuse.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:02.460
This is the Lord's decree.

00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:04.580
You're now summoned to the capital.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.259
Defiance means death.

00:16:13.659 --> 00:16:15.879
(It's the same pattern as
on that jade pendant.)

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.320
(Could it be her?)

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:24.279
Fine.

00:16:25.899 --> 00:16:26.820
I'll go with you.

00:16:38.159 --> 00:16:38.639
Lord.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:40.129
Master of Snowfall Valley is here.

00:16:41.039 --> 00:16:41.519
Good.

00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:44.519
General Nian, you never disappoint me.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.659
Reward.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.960
Thank you, Lord.

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:06.640
(I've finally seen you.)

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.720
I've long heard your fame.

00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:13.759
Though you've secluded,

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.480
still perceived the big picture.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.279
If you can assist me,

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.839
I can unite the six cities.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.920
I'm flattered.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.519
I've long withdrawn

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:29.720
from the worldly ties.

00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:32.000
I might not be able to assist you.

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:34.279
Coming with General Nian today

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.319
was solely to tell you this myself.

00:17:38.839 --> 00:17:39.640
Nothing more.

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:45.160
Don't refuse yet.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.319
Hear my offer.

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:52.960
If you assist me,

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:55.880
henceforth,

00:17:56.759 --> 00:17:58.160
you'll be National Preceptor,

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.119
who only serves me.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.599
- What?
- How could he be?

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.200
When I unite the six cities,

00:18:07.359 --> 00:18:09.200
we'll share the realm.

00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:10.759
It's tempting indeed,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.359
but not what I want.

00:18:14.519 --> 00:18:17.160
What do you want?

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.839
You can't offer

00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:23.599
what I want.

00:18:31.759 --> 00:18:32.559
Leave us.

00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:36.279
I need to speak privately with him.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.240
- Yes, Lord.
- Yes, Lord.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.079
Sir.

00:18:58.559 --> 00:18:59.759
Have we met before?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.880
Why do you ask this?

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:13.400
Because in your eyes,

00:19:14.759 --> 00:19:16.359
there's something different.

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:20.000
But I

00:19:21.759 --> 00:19:22.839
don't understand why.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.720
You misunderstand.

00:19:25.839 --> 00:19:26.960
To me,

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.480
you are nothing different from others.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.599
I see.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.000
Lord.

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:48.839
You are finally here.

00:19:50.279 --> 00:19:50.839
Lord.

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:52.200
It has been a while.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.599
I miss you every single day.

00:19:54.839 --> 00:19:55.799
So do we.

00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:56.559
Exactly.

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:57.960
My duties kept me occupied.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.400
That's why I summoned you here.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:06.119
Who is he?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.680
He is

00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:10.759
a recluse I want to recruit
from seclusion.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.200
Show him proper respect.

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:15.000
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.240
I summoned you

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:18.599
to see

00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:20.400
if the way he looks at me

00:20:21.319 --> 00:20:23.200
is like yours.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.480
Yet he denied it

00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:31.000
and claimed the way he looks at me
is nothing special.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.400
In my opinion,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.119
the way he looks at you

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.359
is way more intense than ours.

00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:40.440
Exactly.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.119
We admire you with devotion,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.359
but he

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.680
harbors soul-crushing anguish

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.200
and obsession.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.000
His eyes reveal
a desire of possessiveness

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.799
to you exclusively.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.920
As if you belong solely to him.

00:20:59.319 --> 00:21:00.319
More than that.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.680
There's madness and repression.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:05.579
Lord.

00:21:06.019 --> 00:21:07.539
Ignore him. Here.

00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:19.519
Get lost!

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.640
You don't seem

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.160
to have long withdrawn
from the worldly ties

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.799
as you claimed.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.759
Since you drove away my playthings,

00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:43.160
then you'll

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.240
come entertain me.

they've always opposed me?

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:35.839
You finally said it.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.599
You're just using me

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.440
to eliminate those ministers
who've opposed you.

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:42.759
So what?

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.039
You said

00:26:45.359 --> 00:26:46.640
to do

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.200
whatever I want.

I fear no label of tyrant,

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:54.559
yet you protect your sage image?

00:26:54.599 --> 00:26:55.599
I don't mean that.

00:26:56.279 --> 00:26:57.599

Do you think I enjoy killing?

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.160

00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:40.359
I have to kill them all!

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.640
Lord.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.799
Stay calm.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.319
Lord.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.960
As a ruler of the nation,

00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:51.640
don't be controlled by dark forces!

00:27:59.759 --> 00:28:02.039
(She can't control
the Night Deity's power within.)

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.160
(Yet I can't help her.)

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.640
By Lord Yongzhao's decree,

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.160
all who refuse surrender

00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:14.480
shall be executed!

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:15.640
Kill them!

00:28:19.759 --> 00:28:20.319
Stop!

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.279
Stop the killing!

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.519
If I spare them,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.759
they'll kill me.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.859
Keeping these disobedient men alive

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.720
undermines my sovereignty.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.759
I've told you.

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:42.440
I oppose the slaughter.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:43.960
If you must kill,

00:28:44.839 --> 00:28:46.000
take my life first.

00:28:48.079 --> 00:28:48.920
Good.

00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:51.400
Very good.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.519
I made you the National Preceptor

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.779
and granted you favor,

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.519
yet you support them.

00:29:01.519 --> 00:29:03.720
I'll kill them all.

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:06.359
Stop waiting.

00:29:07.599 --> 00:29:08.480
Kill them all!

00:29:23.079 --> 00:29:25.960
You killed me?

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:40.319
I treated you so well,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.160
yet you...

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.920
I'll never

00:29:45.799 --> 00:29:47.720
forgive you...

00:29:56.759 --> 00:29:57.559
I'm sorry.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.519
In your next life,

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.720
I'll find you sooner.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:24.568
(Fourth Life)

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.900
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.259
Princes, be seated.

00:30:37.819 --> 00:30:39.779
Today let's study
the Classic of Filial Piety.

00:30:50.759 --> 00:30:52.240
My apologies.

00:30:53.079 --> 00:30:54.119
I overslept

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.559
and came late.

00:30:59.799 --> 00:31:00.559
Who's this guy?

00:31:00.839 --> 00:31:01.960
I haven't seen him before.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.440
He's Zhaolie, the seventh prince
sent as hostage from Jin Kingdom.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.039
Too fragile to be a threat.
