00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.843
Please… help. I…

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.608
You fucked up… your own suicide?

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.277
Just kill me.

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:53.822
Please.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.653
Oh, did you think I was gonna
put you out of your misery?

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.827
Are you fuckin' stupid?

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:45.039
I'm gonna make you fucking suffer.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:47.542
Little bitch.

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.643
I'm gonna make everyone wish
they'd never met me.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.442
Then I'm gonna die
and go straight to hell.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.858
Difficulty, Queen of Clubs.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.904
Game, Target.

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:43.616
Please wait until the game commences.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.933
Did you think I was dead?

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.226
No.

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:13.313
I knew that I would see you again.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:14.647
You're too strong to die.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:16.899
Strong, huh?

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.653
You know, Kuina,

00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.990
I started wondering
if waiting for death might be easier.

00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:26.826
Yeah, I had similar thoughts.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.122
But at least we're both here now.

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.917
Clubs are team games.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.962
It should be much easier
with two of us playing.

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.132
Just a few more games.
We'll make it to the end.

00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:43.968
Huh. Mmm. I'm sure we will.

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.435
Registration has closed.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.645
The game will now commence.

00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:11.472
Don't go in!

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:41.390
Hey!

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:46.646
Fancy meeting you here.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.067
- Chishiya.
- There are only two games left.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.028
Players are starting to gather in Shibuya.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:59.241
I had a pretty good hunch
that you were probably still alive.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:09.585
What?

00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:12.004
Is that the only thing you've gotta say?

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.048
So?

00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:15.633
Nothing. It's just…

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.177
You're a lot less grumpy now.

00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:22.682
Oh, less grumpy, huh?

00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:26.394
Well, I've been through a hell of a lot.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.982
Hey, Arisu…

00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:35.945
can I share something with you

00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:38.572
that I've never told anyone before?

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.537
Yeah.

00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:49.458
Well, I--

00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:52.169
Yo!

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.426
I thought I'd never see you again!

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:00.386
I am so fuckin' happy!

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.138
Niragi!

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.307
Did you mean to miss a vital organ?

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:08.352
I didn't want to end things
with a surprise attack.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.063
So let's begin.

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:13.315
It's a new murder game.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:18.154
Not like there's anything else
for the three of us to do here.

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:21.490
You want to start a game
between players?

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:24.410
The three of us are the same.

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:28.122
Social outcasts. Losers.

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:32.126
Yet we still want to know how it feels
to be alive, more than anyone.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.262
I don't have very much time left.

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:46.223
Do me one last favor.

00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:48.934
One more game, come on!

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:51.687
I thought you guys were my bros!

00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:08.913
Sounds like fun.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.208
Arisu, what do you think?

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.793
What do you mean?

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:17.463
Come on, don't play dumb.
I know you've got a bone to pick with me.

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:19.548
We might as well deal with it right now.

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.468
We can settle things once and for all.

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:25.221
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:28.057
Come on, where's your gun?
I know you got one!

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:32.144
There's gotta be
another way to do this.

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:45.908
Niragi! Stop this!

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.827
I'm just acting like you guys.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.662
Doing whatever I feel like.

00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:52.873
Every time you open your mouths,
it's just to talk about yourselves.

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.042
I've had to listen to your bullshit
the whole time.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.755
Stop acting like you're better than
everyone because you've seen people die.

00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:02.800
And don't say you're trying to survive
for someone else,

00:14:02.883 --> 00:14:05.636
because I know that deep down,
you're just as selfish!

00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:08.430
The only thing that matters
is that we come out on top!

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.561
You said it'd all work out
if we worked together!

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:16.647
From the very start,
you just wanted to be the only survivor!

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.400
I don't want it to end this way!

00:14:19.483 --> 00:14:21.443
Please, or you'll kill everyone.

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:22.695
Do it for them!

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:28.868
Yeah.

00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:31.912
You might have a good point.

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:38.085
Maybe we're all just supposed
to kill each other in this place.

00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:40.212
Now you're starting to make sense.

00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:45.384
Niragi…

00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:50.347
I know what you're trying to do,
but it won't work!

00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:53.934
You're trying to wear me down!

00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:01.942
Except…

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.195
now it won't work.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.909
I'm not gonna act weak and selfish
ever again.

00:15:21.128 --> 00:15:22.212
I'm out.

00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:36.185
I'm not gonna pull this trigger
just so that I can survive.

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:57.164
I'm finally free.

00:15:58.165 --> 00:16:00.125
I made my own choice.

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:04.046
And based on my own ideals.

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:07.424
It's all because of you.

00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:17.518
You ruined it.

00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:20.312
Thanks a lot, asshole.

00:16:24.733 --> 00:16:25.734
Arisu?

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:35.869
What's going on here?

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:44.837
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about you.

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.465
Usagi!

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:51.218
Stop shooting!
She's got nothing to do with this!

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:54.847
Games need a heroine to rescue.
But this one should die.

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:56.890
What are you saying?

00:16:58.517 --> 00:16:59.977
If I kill you now,

00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:03.605
everything can go back to the way it was.

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:09.236
You… just get in the way.

00:17:33.343 --> 00:17:34.887
Chishiya!

00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:37.306
Chishiya!

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:40.392
Chishiya! You saved me!

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:42.478
Why did you do it?

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:46.482
I wanted to do something
that was a bit out of character.

00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:51.195
I know it's thanks
to the people I met here.

00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:53.906
Like Kuzuryu.

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:56.658
Arisu, too.

00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:00.788
Hey.

00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:03.749
Before, what were you gonna say?

00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:07.795
Oh, yeah.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:15.928
Honest people…

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.308
always seemed pretty stupid to me.

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:26.730
I've always loved messing with people

00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:29.441
who try too hard at life.

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:33.904
I hated selflessness.

00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:39.868
It's probably because I was jealous.

00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:43.705
They all had something I was missing.

00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:47.501
It was like

00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:49.711
they could always see

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:53.674
what a pathetic and small-minded person
I really was.

00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:58.595
I was always afraid.

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:04.518
I get you.

00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:10.691
Yeah, I thought
you'd be the one to understand.

00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:20.450
I guess hunting rifles

00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:22.703
aren't as deadly as you thought.

00:19:30.919 --> 00:19:32.296
Whatever you do,

00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:36.508
just don't make me out to be the villain.

00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:42.598
If there were seven billion of me,

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:46.310
you guys

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.520
would all be villains too.

00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:55.861
You're pretty lucky, you know.

00:19:58.322 --> 00:20:00.157
You guys are the majority.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.536
Run.

00:20:57.422 --> 00:20:59.424
- Hide them under the cars.
- Okay.

00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:22.322
The only blimps left are the King
of Spades and the Queen of Hearts.

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:25.575
Anybody who's left is gathering in Shibuya
now that they've seen the blimps.

00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:28.537
We can't go further until we take down
the King of Spades.

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:32.082
Huh? Look!

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:39.423
Kuina! Ann!

00:21:40.507 --> 00:21:42.134
Arisu!

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:49.933
It's been a while.

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:51.727
You're both okay. I'm so glad.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.395
It's good to see you again.

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:55.063
Did Chishiya make it?

00:21:56.773 --> 00:21:57.691
Yeah.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.987
I saw him. He's good.

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:03.822
Great.

00:22:03.905 --> 00:22:06.241
Looks like the King of Spades
wants to settle things here.

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.201
We'll take the King down together.

00:22:39.274 --> 00:22:40.150
Ann!

00:22:43.403 --> 00:22:44.738
No! No!

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:32.786
Yeah! We did it!

00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:34.204
- We got him!
- Finally!

00:23:34.287 --> 00:23:36.248
- We're finally free!
- Finally! Yeah!

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.543
- We did it!
- Yeah!

00:24:17.205 --> 00:24:18.707
Arisu!

00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:40.729
Shit!

00:25:02.959 --> 00:25:04.878
- I keep missing. Fuck.
- Let's go!

00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:17.641
Arisu!

00:25:24.064 --> 00:25:25.607
Come on! They're in here!

00:25:32.572 --> 00:25:33.907
Arisu!

00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:39.204
Heya.

00:25:40.622 --> 00:25:41.623
Are you Usagi?

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:43.375
Yeah.

00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:46.336
Good to meet you.

00:25:50.298 --> 00:25:53.218
He'll run out of ammo soon.

00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:55.220
Stay in here where there's cover.

00:25:55.303 --> 00:25:56.721
Aguni?

00:25:57.222 --> 00:25:59.891
Aguni. What are you doing here?

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.770
I followed you here.

00:26:05.146 --> 00:26:06.690
So you do love me.

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:13.905
He's just human.
He's not invincible.

00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:16.366
And as for his guns,

00:26:16.449 --> 00:26:18.159
he won't be able to shoot forever.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.997
Once he runs out of ammo,
he'll need to restock.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.207
I think they drop supplies
from the blimps.

00:26:27.002 --> 00:26:28.295
We've all got weapons.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.140
But this is all the ammo I've got left.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.532
I almost forgot.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.493
My good luck charm.

00:27:00.577 --> 00:27:02.370
This is the bomb Chishiya made.

00:27:03.413 --> 00:27:04.456
Chishiya?

00:27:05.248 --> 00:27:06.708
A lot of good that toy will do us.

00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:10.045
We can lure him in
and use it at close range.

00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:15.008
From the way it smells,
I'm guessing the bomb contains kerosene.

00:27:15.091 --> 00:27:16.593
An ANFO bomb.

00:27:16.676 --> 00:27:18.970
Then the explosion it makes
won't be that big.

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:22.432
I can see a drugstore over there.

00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:24.559
If we can fill it up with gas,

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.853
then the explosion will be bigger.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.480
Are you sure?

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.107
Probably.

00:27:31.691 --> 00:27:34.819
So you're saying, someone needs
to lure the King of Spades in there?

00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:36.321
Yeah.

00:27:37.113 --> 00:27:40.116
I'll wait for him inside the store,
and then trigger it.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.285
You're going to die if you do that.

00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:44.621
No. I'll make it out.

00:27:44.704 --> 00:27:45.747
How?

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.541
When the bomb detonates,

00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:50.585
if I'm on the second floor,

00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:52.587
I'll be able to survive the fall.

00:27:53.963 --> 00:27:55.048
Probably.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.594
You know, you say "probably" a lot.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.681
His "probably" is worth betting on.

00:28:02.764 --> 00:28:04.265
It's worth its weight in gold.

00:28:05.475 --> 00:28:06.559
I'll be the bait.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.687
I'll lure him in.

00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:12.065
It's reckless to try to do it alone.

00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:14.693
I've handled a lot worse.

00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:18.947
We'll… we'll do it together.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.158
Yes, together. Just leave it to us.

00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:35.422
All right, then. Let's do it.

00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:03.908
We'll lure him to an alley
so he can't get more ammo from the blimp.

00:29:04.451 --> 00:29:06.870
Then we'll lure him
to the drugstore from there.

00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:09.372
I'm gonna go first.

00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:12.167
While I'm doing that,
you'll go to the alley and draw him in.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.294
- Okay.
- Arisu.

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:17.255
Make sure that store is filled with gas.

00:29:18.047 --> 00:29:18.965
Yeah.

00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:28.117
This thing's a piece of shit!

00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:30.161
Oh!

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:47.595
Ann, you almost hit me!

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:50.932
I'm making sure I don't hit you!

00:33:46.566 --> 00:33:47.775
Ann!

00:38:11.038 --> 00:38:12.415
Come out.

00:38:16.043 --> 00:38:17.211
Come here.

00:39:14.435 --> 00:39:15.728
Come on.

00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:17.897
Come on.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.652
Arisu! Do it!

00:40:07.154 --> 00:40:08.322
Aguni!

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:10.157
Are you crazy?

00:40:13.828 --> 00:40:14.829
Throw it!

00:42:05.648 --> 00:42:06.649
Aguni!

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.652
Go.

00:42:14.657 --> 00:42:17.034
- Where are they?
- They're all okay.

00:42:18.994 --> 00:42:21.330
You've gotta go on to the last game.

00:42:43.936 --> 00:42:45.187
Usagi!

00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:50.359
Usagi!

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:53.237
Usagi!

00:42:55.155 --> 00:42:56.115
Usagi!

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.541
I'm-- I'm sorry.

00:45:22.177 --> 00:45:24.221
That was the only way…

00:45:29.935 --> 00:45:33.564
that I knew how to save you.

00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:53.542
Sorry.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.516
I want you to know…

00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:14.062
I never held it against you.

00:46:46.178 --> 00:46:47.930
What am I supposed to do now?

00:47:17.751 --> 00:47:18.752
Mori.

00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:33.433
What are you doing here?

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.603
Should I beg your forgiveness?

00:47:39.273 --> 00:47:40.107
Nah.

00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:43.652
I'm the one who should

00:47:45.279 --> 00:47:46.697
beg you to forgive me.

00:47:51.785 --> 00:47:53.495
I forced my best friend

00:47:54.746 --> 00:47:56.874
into a role he didn't want to play.

00:48:12.306 --> 00:48:13.599
Take care, my friend.

00:49:51.405 --> 00:49:53.073
Aguni.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.128
Shit.

00:50:07.963 --> 00:50:10.090
I can't get up.

00:50:13.218 --> 00:50:14.845
There's…

00:50:18.807 --> 00:50:20.434
…only one left.

00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:22.269
Huh…

00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:24.604
Huh?

00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:28.692
Ann, you're

00:50:29.818 --> 00:50:31.028
still alive.

00:50:36.408 --> 00:50:37.451
Promise…

00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:42.289
…if we meet again…

00:50:48.295 --> 00:50:49.713
…we'll be friends.

00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:09.775
Ann.

00:51:12.194 --> 00:51:13.236
Ann?

00:51:27.125 --> 00:51:28.418
Usagi!

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.424
Usagi?

00:51:49.064 --> 00:51:51.608
This is the final game.

00:51:51.691 --> 00:51:55.737
Participating players
should register immediately.

00:53:13.565 --> 00:53:14.941
If the rules

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:18.570
force the players
to start killing each other…

00:53:20.405 --> 00:53:21.698
I promise that

00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:23.950
I'm going to protect you.

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:26.786
That

00:53:27.662 --> 00:53:28.955
makes you sound…

00:53:32.209 --> 00:53:34.294
…ridiculous right now.

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:08.013
Welcome

00:55:08.763 --> 00:55:10.932
to your final game venue!
