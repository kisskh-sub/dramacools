00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.443
No one else is gonna die.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.279
We'll make it out if we work together.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.075
Let's all get to the exit.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:36.494
Obviously.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:41.291
Nobu, you'll be heading away
from the exit,

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:45.003
but can you return to C3
and meet up with Rei in C4?

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:48.673
The starting room has no point deduction,
so it's a safe bet.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.515
Understood.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.310
Usagi has the most points.

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:05.273
I have our baby's points as well.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.319
Can you head west to A3?

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.864
It's a room that might have
a large point deduction.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:17.827
Got it.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:23.083
One of you will be forced to stay.

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:26.878
Stop it.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:34.803
You all right?

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:36.304
I'll take over.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:38.473
Thank you.

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.199
I'll stay.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:58.493
Why?

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:02.872
I'm the oldest, so I'll stay.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.709
Leave the dangerous work to an adult.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:10.672
The future belongs to the youth.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:22.559
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.352
Don't worry!

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:39.779
B4 is a minus-two-point room.

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:41.281
RYUJI: 6, YUNA: 11, ARISU: 3

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:44.951
Please select whose points to use.

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.578
Let's use my points here.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.792
Point deduction confirmed.

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.721
A3 is a minus-eight-point room.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:08.725
Please select whose points to use.

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:14.522
I will protect you.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.195
Point deduction confirmed.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:24.699
What about Tetsu?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.751
Got it.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.090
Tetsu!

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.139
Tetsu.

00:05:57.315 --> 00:06:00.777
This is a minus-eight-point room.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.571
We would've been history.

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:08.201
We can't pass through here again.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.537
Eleventh turn.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:12.622
Begin.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.708
Let's get Sachiko out of there.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:21.089
FORCED STAY

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:26.135
Usagi and Nobu need to stay put
to keep Sachiko's room between them.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.223
But Nobu only has two points,
which will be reduced to zero

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:34.811
if he tries to meet up with Sachiko
after she's released.

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:40.191
Want me to meet up with Nobu in C3
and use my points?

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:41.275
No.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:44.153
Even if you go to C3 to meet up with Nobu,

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:47.448
you'll never reach A5
with both of your points.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.492
15TH TURN
MOVE -1

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.538
Rei, I want you to stay in C4
to save Sachiko.

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:56.124
Then meet up with Nobu there.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:57.625
You got it.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:03.131
If I'm in A2,
I can form a diagonal line with Rei in C4.

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.675
So our baby and I will go to A2.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.804
But no one has entered A2 yet.

00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:13.850
Our baby and I
still have seven points each.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.437
We don't know whether A2
has a large point deduction.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:21.107
No one can help you
if you're forced to stay in A2.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.485
One mistake,
and we won't reach A5 in 15 turns.

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:29.449
Time's almost up.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.367
What should we do?

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.455
How can we all make it home alive?

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.207
How?

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:42.962
There has to be a way.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:49.302
We've battled many opponents.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.101
I owe my life to all of you.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.454
We've always found a way to survive.

00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:54.158
The wristband.

00:08:57.995 --> 00:08:59.080
Use the wristband.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:00.790
What?

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:04.377
Put our baby's wristband in room A2.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.673
The baby obviously can't wear it.

00:09:09.173 --> 00:09:11.133
But it has functioned so far.

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:15.304
It should function
even without anyone accompanying it.

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:22.562
That's absurd.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:27.733
What if the baby dies
while you're trying to save me?!

00:09:29.193 --> 00:09:30.152
I realize that.

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.904
Even if we win,

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:36.284
Usagi might die if the baby's wristband
isn't retrieved and runs out of points!

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:41.289
What if there's a way to get it back?

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:42.623
How?

00:09:43.207 --> 00:09:46.460
Entering the room defeats the purpose
of using the baby's wristband.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.805
You shouldn't see this! Go with Rei!

00:09:57.888 --> 00:09:59.473
Yuna, come back.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:01.601
-Hurry!
-Yuna.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:10.067
Rei's wristband didn't react when it was
outside while she leaned into this room.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:15.489
Then I should be fine
as long as my wristband doesn't leave A3.

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:19.493
Only extend the other hand
to grab the wristband in A2.

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.872
Usagi, can you do it?

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:26.250
Yes.

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:30.254
Eight points will be deducted
when the wristband reenters A3.

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:33.424
Even if Usagi pulls it back from A2 to A3,

00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:36.385
she and the baby
won't have enough points to survive.

00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:50.524
YUNA ITSUKI: 11, RYOHEI ARISU: 6

00:11:01.243 --> 00:11:02.161
Yuna.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:05.998
I have a favor to ask.

00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:12.546
Some of us won't survive without you.

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:17.551
Please save us.

00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:24.225
Please.

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:48.207
Nobu, meet me in C4, okay?

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.333
Will do.

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:56.924
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:12.273
Forgive me.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.651
I'll come get you, I promise.

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:17.713
B3 UNLOCKED

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:23.260
Room B3 has been unlocked.

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:29.892
Good.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:37.608
A2 is a minus-five-point room.

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:42.321
Point deduction confirmed.

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:56.418
Twelfth turn. Begin.

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:05.386
Okay, let's get the wristband back.

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:07.763
Wait for me.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:13.894
We'll open the door from our side.
Yuna will take the eight-point deduction.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.189
She will?

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:22.903
Yes. And while I'm in there,
please get your baby's wristband.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.447
Thank you.

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.032
There won't be much time.

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.827
We have to do it
before the doors close again.

00:14:30.327 --> 00:14:31.245
How long?

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:34.456
The amount of time differs.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.836
Doors stay open the longest
when there is someone in the doorway.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.755
How many seconds max?

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:44.300
About ten seconds.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.094
I can do it.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.015
Okay, let's go with this plan.

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:53.225
Got it.

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.496
MOM, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:18.751
All right.

00:15:19.793 --> 00:15:22.254
Ten seconds. I'll count.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.346
I'm going in.

00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:38.979
What happened?

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:41.440
Ten!

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:45.319
Nine!

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:50.616
Eight!

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:55.955
Seven!

00:15:58.749 --> 00:15:59.625
Six!

00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:04.588
Five!

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:06.924
Hurry!

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.594
Four!

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:18.602
Three!

00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:26.986
Two!

00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:30.280
This is a minus-eight-point room.

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:31.991
-Usagi!
-Point deduction confirmed.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.314
Don't go!

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:07.609
Usagi!

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:09.820
One!

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:16.493
Jump!

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:43.353
Thank you.

00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.336
Arisuâ€¦

00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:10.881
what future did you see?

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.366
The players left in this room
will be forced to stay.

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:40.202
It's the last room.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.634
Thank you.

00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:05.227
STAY - RYUJI

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.479
Point deduction confirmed.

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:08.647
STAY - YUNA
STAY - ARISU

00:19:14.194 --> 00:19:15.404
Fourteenth turn.

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:16.697
Begin.

00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:46.476
It'll be okay, Yu.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.895
Please wait here.

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:49.396
Yuâ€¦

00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:58.614
You idiot!

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.922
How do you propose to fix this?

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.673
Please forgive me.

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:20.219
Bowing your head solves nothing!

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:23.972
Momâ€¦

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:45.994
EXIT

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.087
Arisu.

00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:57.965
What does this mean?

00:20:58.048 --> 00:21:00.467
It said "exit" just now.

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.719
That's the last room, right?

00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:05.055
What happens there?

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.398
Hold your wristband to the chosen door

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:16.942
and proceed to the next room.

00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:25.492
Let's go.

00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:41.341
Arisu.

00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:42.676
Nobu.

00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:44.428
What a relief.

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:51.184
15TH TURN

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:55.355
The last turn. We barely made it.

00:21:56.815 --> 00:22:00.485
You have reached the exit room.

00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:07.868
EXIT

00:22:49.576 --> 00:22:54.790
Now that you have reached the exit,
it's time to roll one last time.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.833
"Roll"?

00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:08.387
Really?

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.145
I'll do it.

00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:39.459
I take this fate

00:23:41.044 --> 00:23:42.212
upon myself.

00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:44.297
Arisu.

00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:16.580
Seven players may now proceed to the exit.

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:29.134
"Seven."

00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:31.761
One of us must stay.

00:24:49.863 --> 00:24:50.822
Usagi.

00:24:52.657 --> 00:24:53.909
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:24:54.701 --> 00:24:55.535
Huh?

00:24:57.037 --> 00:24:58.121
What do you mean?

00:24:58.205 --> 00:24:59.331
You must live.

00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:04.419
Along with everyone else.

00:25:06.922 --> 00:25:09.007
One minute remaining.

00:25:09.799 --> 00:25:11.301
-Please.
-Arisu.

00:25:11.384 --> 00:25:13.929
-This is the future I saw.
-No.

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:15.597
-Absolutely not!
-Usagi.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.849
-No! You can't!
-Please.

00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:19.351
-No!
-Usagi!

00:25:19.434 --> 00:25:20.435
-No way!
-Usagi!

00:25:21.394 --> 00:25:22.229
No!

00:25:22.312 --> 00:25:25.982
Everyone, please,
get her out of here alive.

00:25:26.066 --> 00:25:27.150
No!

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:28.318
Don't!

00:25:28.401 --> 00:25:29.694
Ryuji!

00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:32.531
Ryuji, make sure
Usagi gets back to our world.

00:25:32.614 --> 00:25:34.241
-No!
-Please.

00:25:34.324 --> 00:25:36.993
-No!
-Thirty seconds remaining.

00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:38.370
Everyone, hurry!

00:25:38.453 --> 00:25:39.287
Arisu!

00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:41.915
There's no time! Sachiko, hurry!

00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:43.875
-Arisu, no!
-Hurry!

00:25:44.584 --> 00:25:45.418
Arisu!

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:49.381
Ryuji, make sure
Usagi gets back to our world.

00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:50.674
Promise me!

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:52.300
Ryuji, please.

00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:55.303
Arisu!

00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:58.723
No!

00:26:00.642 --> 00:26:01.977
Arisu, wait!

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:04.563
Arisu!

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.276
No! Arisu!

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:24.351
Let's go to the world of death together.

00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:32.984
Your wish will be granted

00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:34.986
if you kill her.

00:27:36.863 --> 00:27:39.199
You'll discover the true world of death

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:42.369
that lies beyond here.

00:28:04.474 --> 00:28:05.684
What is he doing?

00:28:11.606 --> 00:28:12.440
Usagi!

00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:14.818
Hey! Ryuji!

00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:16.778
Stop! Ryuji!

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:19.614
Hey! Don't do it, Ryuji!

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:20.990
What are you doing?

00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:23.034
Usagi! Hey!

00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:24.536
Ryuji!

00:28:24.619 --> 00:28:26.913
Don't do it! Hey!

00:28:33.837 --> 00:28:36.047
Don't! Hey!

00:28:36.131 --> 00:28:36.965
No!

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:18.757
Congratulations.

00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:25.805
You chose to remain in this room
so that others may live.

00:29:25.889 --> 00:29:29.392
You have proven yourself
worthy of a future.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:35.023
Whoever remains in this room
wins the game.

00:29:38.067 --> 00:29:38.902
What?

00:31:01.985 --> 00:31:02.986
Usagi!

00:31:05.947 --> 00:31:06.948
Usagi!

00:31:32.974 --> 00:31:34.517
Congratulations, Arisu.

00:31:48.823 --> 00:31:49.908
Youâ€¦

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:58.082
Your splendid victory earns you the right
to join our select group of citizens.

00:31:58.833 --> 00:31:59.834
A citizen?

00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:02.629
No way I'd join you!

00:32:02.712 --> 00:32:05.798
Usagi, the rabbit you've been chasing,
will soon die.

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:11.012
So, Arisu, let's enjoy some more games
together in this land.

00:32:13.556 --> 00:32:16.684
So I'm here to entertain you?

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:18.353
That's right.

00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:20.939
You son of a bitch.

00:32:22.398 --> 00:32:25.526
I knew it'd be difficult
to persuade you to come here.

00:32:26.402 --> 00:32:29.113
So I used her as bait.

00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:33.910
You played right into my hands.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.246
Goddamn you!

00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:45.922
Damn it!

00:34:19.307 --> 00:34:20.975
-Are you all right?
-Arisu!

00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:24.520
Ryuji!

00:34:26.105 --> 00:34:27.065
Ryuji!

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:29.984
Grab on.

00:34:34.113 --> 00:34:35.156
Sachiko!

00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:37.533
Sachiko!

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:42.205
Yuna!

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.625
-You got this?
-Huh?

00:34:49.003 --> 00:34:49.962
Usagi!

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.097
-Arisu!
-Arisu!

00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:02.308
Get inside, quick!

00:35:05.394 --> 00:35:06.395
Usagi!

00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:11.275
Usagi!

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:15.446
Arisu!

00:35:19.242 --> 00:35:20.243
Usagi!

00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:36.611
Usagi!

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.294
It's over.

00:37:37.838 --> 00:37:38.756
Wait a sec.

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:41.968
You can see me?

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.116
Damn you.

00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:23.384
Arisu?

00:38:24.427 --> 00:38:25.428
Arisu.

00:38:26.929 --> 00:38:29.015
Arisu!

00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:31.058
Bring Usagi back with you!

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.810
Arisu!

00:39:14.101 --> 00:39:16.270
Very impressive, Arisu.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.531
Ready to become a citizen?

00:39:30.242 --> 00:39:31.786
Ask all you want,

00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:35.414
but I'll never become a citizen.

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.337
You disappoint me.

00:39:45.758 --> 00:39:47.802
Goodbye, Arisu.

00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:05.986
It seems he wasn't
quite ready for this role.

00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:01.584
Are you the Joker?

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:05.421
Who is the Joker, you ask?

00:41:06.088 --> 00:41:07.715
A god, perhaps?

00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:10.926
Orâ€¦ is it me?

00:41:14.555 --> 00:41:16.140
Let's play one last game.

00:41:20.102 --> 00:41:21.187
Take a seat.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.380
Choose one of these cards.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.675
Your choice will seal your fate.

00:41:55.387 --> 00:42:00.100
I win if you draw the Joker.

00:42:00.726 --> 00:42:04.730
Your fate will be in my hands.

00:42:55.155 --> 00:42:58.909
Your fate now belongs to me.

00:43:00.703 --> 00:43:02.913
They're both Jokers, aren't they?

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.421
Imagine that.

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:13.382
Cut the crap.

00:43:14.174 --> 00:43:15.509
You cheated.

00:43:16.176 --> 00:43:17.011
Listen.

00:43:18.804 --> 00:43:21.849
A deck of cards
consists of four suits with 13 cards each.

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:26.562
Add them up, and you get 364.

00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:31.400
Add a Joker, and it's 365.

00:43:31.483 --> 00:43:35.863
That's right, the same number of days
as a year in the mortal realm.

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:42.161
Add another Joker, and it's 366.

00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:44.121
A leap year.

00:43:46.832 --> 00:43:52.880
They are indispensable cards tied to
the nature of time in the mortal realm.

00:43:55.507 --> 00:43:58.302
They're jesters that fill
the gaps between cards,

00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:00.137
the gaps in time,

00:44:01.388 --> 00:44:05.225
and the gap between life and death.

00:44:08.062 --> 00:44:09.480
Is that you?

00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:11.231
The Joker

00:44:12.107 --> 00:44:13.525
isn't a person.

00:44:14.777 --> 00:44:20.824
It's neither the ruler of this world
nor the master of these games.

00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:22.451
It's simply

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:24.536
a card.

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:32.753
You're an intriguing character.

00:44:34.296 --> 00:44:36.674
I imagine it was no coincidence

00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:40.094
that the two cards
that could seal your fate were Jokers.

00:44:42.429 --> 00:44:47.142
Your fate is now mine to do as I please.

00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:51.230
Butâ€¦

00:44:52.773 --> 00:44:54.900
I give thanks for that coincidence

00:44:55.734 --> 00:44:58.278
by granting you the freedom to choose.

00:45:06.578 --> 00:45:07.579
Behold.

00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:10.624
That is death.

00:45:42.281 --> 00:45:45.826
That vortex pulls you in, and you die.

00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:57.921
In the other direction is life.

00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:04.553
Life is hard, with countless ordeals.

00:46:05.721 --> 00:46:10.851
But death comes easily
if you cast yourself into the flow.

00:46:13.645 --> 00:46:15.147
Which will you choose?

00:46:17.524 --> 00:46:19.526
Everyone eventually comes here.

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:24.531
It's the world between life and death.

00:46:25.491 --> 00:46:28.160
Even if you return
to the world of the living,

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:33.332
you'll inevitably return here
within a few decades.

00:46:34.374 --> 00:46:35.501
Ultimately,

00:46:37.002 --> 00:46:39.046
all roads lead to death.

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:46.345
Do you still wish to return to your world,
even if it means pain and anguish?

00:46:50.891 --> 00:46:52.893
Even if you return,

00:46:54.144 --> 00:46:58.649
the woman and child you seek
may no longer be there.

00:47:00.234 --> 00:47:02.402
Entering the world of death is easy.

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:06.907
Simply cast yourself into that vortex.

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:11.537
It's emptier than you imagine.

00:47:13.413 --> 00:47:16.667
No suffering, no sadness.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.419
No joy either.

00:47:27.886 --> 00:47:29.721
Why are you here?

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:36.979
I'm no more than a watchman

00:47:37.062 --> 00:47:40.148
watching over the rift
between life and death.

00:47:41.942 --> 00:47:43.277
Everyone dies.

00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:48.365
I merely keep watch here

00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:52.786
so that I don't have to
pass through death's door.

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:57.165
You encourage others to die,

00:47:58.333 --> 00:48:00.168
yet you're afraid of death?

00:48:03.672 --> 00:48:04.965
Perhaps.

00:48:07.676 --> 00:48:09.177
That's why you asked me?

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:15.642
I wanted to hear from someone
who survived many brushes with death.

00:48:22.107 --> 00:48:24.693
Countless others will be arriving soon.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.487
"Countless others"?

00:48:32.117 --> 00:48:33.160
What's happening?

00:48:35.495 --> 00:48:36.580
Who knows?

00:48:37.956 --> 00:48:43.003
But it's bigger than
what brought you all here the last time.

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.174
Are many people going to die?

00:48:49.051 --> 00:48:50.719
That's none of my concern.

00:49:09.154 --> 00:49:12.032
Now, make your choice!

00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:20.624
I'll take Usagi back to our world.

00:49:26.505 --> 00:49:27.381
Usagi?

00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:37.015
Usagi!

00:49:37.766 --> 00:49:38.600
Well?

00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:41.979
Now what?

00:49:54.032 --> 00:49:56.868
You really are an intriguing character.

00:50:19.057 --> 00:50:20.058
Usagi!

00:50:33.947 --> 00:50:34.781
Arisu!

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:36.867
Usagi!

00:50:43.123 --> 00:50:44.207
Let's go together!

00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:46.460
Arisu!

00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:49.671
Hey, Ryuji!

00:51:03.977 --> 00:51:06.271
Let's go to the world of death together.

00:51:06.354 --> 00:51:07.272
What?

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.816
No! Ryuji!

00:51:12.194 --> 00:51:13.403
Usagi!

00:51:14.696 --> 00:51:16.490
Ryuji! No!

00:51:21.453 --> 00:51:23.413
Hey! Ryuji!

00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:51.817
Arisu!

00:51:53.485 --> 00:51:54.486
Arisu!

00:52:00.117 --> 00:52:01.326
Usagi!

00:52:04.996 --> 00:52:05.831
Usagi!

00:52:08.416 --> 00:52:09.668
Arisu!

00:52:10.377 --> 00:52:11.419
Arisu!

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.380
Usagi!

00:52:35.235 --> 00:52:36.403
Arisu!

00:52:37.529 --> 00:52:38.572
Arisu!

00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:41.867
Arisu!

00:52:43.201 --> 00:52:46.037
Ryuji, make sure
Usagi gets back to our world.

00:52:46.538 --> 00:52:47.581
Promise me!

00:53:33.126 --> 00:53:34.669
You must live, together.

00:53:41.218 --> 00:53:42.469
Ryuji!

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.381
Yuzuha.

00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:20.442
Yuzuha.

00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:23.611
Dad.

00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:48.803
Iâ€¦

00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:53.516
missed you so much.

00:55:59.314 --> 00:56:00.398
I was

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.193
so happy.

00:56:07.655 --> 00:56:08.656
Dadâ€¦

00:56:20.001 --> 00:56:21.503
That's why I want

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:24.672
you to be happy too.

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.007
Arisu!

00:59:09.337 --> 00:59:10.338
Arisu.

00:59:33.194 --> 00:59:36.030
How long has it been?

00:59:38.575 --> 00:59:39.659
Two minutes.

00:59:41.286 --> 00:59:42.579
You barely made it.

00:59:45.206 --> 00:59:47.375
You were seconds away from death.

00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:50.712
What about Usagi?

00:59:51.212 --> 00:59:52.505
What happened to her?

00:59:55.008 --> 00:59:57.302
You should know better than anyone.

00:59:59.846 --> 01:00:00.680
I gotta go.

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:03.725
I'm fine.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.861
Thank you, Ann.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:47.185
Usagi?

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:12.460
What a relief.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.304
I'm hungry.

01:01:34.607 --> 01:01:35.775
Arisuâ€¦

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.365
The baby will be born in summer, soâ€¦

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.117
It will be summer, soâ€¦

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.952
-Natsumi?
-"Natsumi"?

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.205
The kanji for "summer" and "beautiful."

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:32.373
"Beautiful."

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:34.167
RINKA, NATSUKI, KANADE, KOHARU, NATSUMI

01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:38.212
What else is there?

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.923
How about this?

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.300
-Hiiro?
-Yeah.

01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:45.052
That one's good too.

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:50.141
You keep saying that,
but it's time to narrow it down.

01:02:50.224 --> 01:02:54.270
We'll never decide
if we keep writing down the ones you like.

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:57.315
What else is there?

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:03.112
Whatever you like is fine.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:04.447
There it is.

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:06.991
So you'll be a lazy father?

01:03:07.074 --> 01:03:08.409
No.

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.369
I am thinking about it,

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:17.293
but it feels like our names
shape our destiny, so I just can't choose.

01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:20.171
You should be the one to--

01:03:20.254 --> 01:03:22.423
No way! We'll decide together.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.094
-I'm gonna be late!
-Huh?

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:28.095
I gotta go.

01:03:29.847 --> 01:03:31.641
Hey, don't run away.

01:03:35.394 --> 01:03:38.564
I'd never do that. I won't ever leave you.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.401
I know.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:47.657
So narrow it down to one name by tonight.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:50.076
-What?
-We'll do the final vote tonight.

01:03:50.701 --> 01:03:51.994
Now off you go.

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:54.080
See you later.

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:14.308
Thanks for coming.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:17.395
I graduated, thanks to you, Mom.

01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:19.480
That's not true.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.400
Now it's my turn.

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:23.776
What?

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:27.613
It's my turn to make you happy.

01:04:30.908 --> 01:04:32.451
It's game on.

01:04:34.745 --> 01:04:36.122
-I was thinkingâ€¦
-Yeah?

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.583
-Let's visit his grave together.
-Really?

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:42.295
Yeah, it's about time
I introduce you to my brother,

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:44.088
like, "This is my boyfriend."

01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:45.339
-I see.
-Yeah.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.551
-Then I better start thinking.
-About what?

01:04:48.634 --> 01:04:51.387
-What to wear and say.
-It doesn't matter.

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:52.597
Just in case.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.391
-So what will you wear?
-I don't know.

01:04:55.474 --> 01:04:56.642
-A suit orâ€¦
-A suit?

01:04:56.726 --> 01:05:01.689
Don't forget your phone in the bathroom.
You start middle school, so act like it.

01:05:01.772 --> 01:05:02.732
I know.

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:05.735
Seriously, where'd you get that from?

01:05:05.818 --> 01:05:07.486
It could only be you, Mom.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:09.280
What?

01:05:11.532 --> 01:05:12.575
You're right.

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:15.328
I read your letter.

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:18.623
Thanks for watching it, Mom.

01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:22.752
Yeah, I'll be working
on an anime again soon.

01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:27.298
Yeah, this time it's for a movie.

01:05:28.132 --> 01:05:30.134
See it with Dad when it comes out.

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:31.469
Okay.

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.890
ARISU

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.896
Thank you. Would you like to
schedule your next appointment?

01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:45.608
Do you have any openings in mid-May?

01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:47.234
One moment, please.

01:05:48.986 --> 01:05:52.490
What makes you feel
like life is worth living?

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:54.450
"Worth living"?

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:03.292
I guess it's when I do karate.

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:05.586
Didn't you stop for a while?

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.923
I started teaching
at my dad's karate school.

01:06:10.007 --> 01:06:12.510
The kids are so eager to practice.

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:16.138
Seeing that makes me so happy.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.814
Do you ever have flashbacks?

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:28.693
I'm able to sleep better now.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:30.945
I'm used to my job too.

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:32.697
That's good.

01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:38.119
You said you've been thinking a lot
about the meaning of life.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:43.749
I think, "Why am I alive?"

01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:53.467
Maybe it's to work hard
so the hat shop won't go under.

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:06.564
What makes you feel
like life is worth living?

01:07:06.647 --> 01:07:10.484
When everyone recognizes me
as an influencer, of course.

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:16.490
This is how I'll spread my wings
in this world.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.123
I like your spirit.

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:32.048
What makes you feel
like life is worth living?

01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:38.554
There was a time when I felt like
I shouldn't have gotten a second chance.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:44.894
But maybe that's the point,
and I have to prove I can do better.

01:07:47.938 --> 01:07:49.023
Now,

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.568
I work hard for the sake of my rug rat.

01:07:57.656 --> 01:07:58.657
"Worth living"?

01:08:04.663 --> 01:08:05.706
Good question.

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:20.137
Even if you don't know the answer,

01:08:21.222 --> 01:08:22.556
it's not so bad, is it?

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:24.600
Life, I mean.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.645
That's true.

01:08:30.731 --> 01:08:31.941
How about you?

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:37.571
What makes you feel
like life is worth living?

01:08:38.572 --> 01:08:39.490
Me?

01:08:41.575 --> 01:08:42.910
Let me think.

01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:46.705
Right now, it'sâ€¦

01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:51.043
when I'm thinking of names for my kid.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:54.839
I see.

01:09:11.105 --> 01:09:12.857
-I'll leave it here.
-Thanks.

01:09:23.784 --> 01:09:24.869
Feel that?

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:26.078
Another earthquake?

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.594
It stopped, right?

01:09:41.677 --> 01:09:42.553
Yep.

01:09:43.053 --> 01:09:45.514
-That was a big one the other day.
-Yeah.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.224
There have been a lot lately.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:48.601
There have.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:49.935
Let's check the news.

01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:54.106
The Japan Meteorological Agency
says the epicenter

01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:57.568
was off the southeast coast of Chiba,
at a depth of 61 km.

01:09:58.068 --> 01:10:00.613
No tsunami warnings have been issued.

01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:06.452
An earthquake with an intensity of 5 Lower
was recently recorded in the Kanto region.

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:12.499
The quake was also recorded in California,
among other locations worldwide.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.963
Experts believe this could be
a sign of global tectonic activityâ€¦

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:15.784
