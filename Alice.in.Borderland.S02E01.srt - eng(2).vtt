00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:20.520
Drop that!

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:22.439
{\an8}- Go, go, go.
- Go, go, go!

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.527
Code five!

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.906
Son, you'll be late for the interview.

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:38.288
{\an8}Is killing people in a game
really fun for you?

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.459
Shit!

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:45.628
Go, go, go, go!

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.065
Come on! Up the stairs! We can make it!

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.609
Come on, run!

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.533
Come on! Over--

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:25.085
13 MINUTES AGO

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:41.142
None of the games have started yet.

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:44.521
Maybe we still have time.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:48.066
Or they forgot
to push the big red start button.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.319
They didn't even tell us
about the rules for this one.

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:07.168
What is it?

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:12.006
I hear something.

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:40.201
They're alive. Beach people.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:10.773
What is this?

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.193
What are you doing here?

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.652
We saw the blimps show up.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.655
There are rumors
that the next stage is starting.

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:19.407
Right…

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.367
Here's the thing--

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.495
Huh?

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:28.666
Oh God!

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.751
A rifle.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.294
- What's happening?
- Get moving.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.754
Run to the car!

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.839
That thing's an anti-tank rifle.

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:41.054
- So I'd forget about hiding behind a car.
- What the hell?

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.639
Where's it coming from?

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:45.058
Run! Run!

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.522
- Does this mean the game's started?
- I don't know.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.024
Did they give us any rules?

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:55.610
Without rules,
this is just a massacre!

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.698
That rifle can kill from a kilometer away.

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:05.370
Damn it, I recognize that sound.

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.247
Now we've got an assault rifle.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.207
We have no idea how many there are.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.376
Other players are starting
to group together.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.628
- Could be more than one shooter.
- Getting closer!

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:16.339
I had no idea
so many players were still alive.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:17.590
Run!

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.509
They're almost here.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.886
We have to go!

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.513
- Come on!
- Help me!

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:29.852
Let's go!

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.689
Arisu!

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.941
This is bad!

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.360
We need to split up!

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.797
{\an8}Kill, kill, kill, kill!
Go, go, go!

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:00.675
Go! Come on!

00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:28.494
Arisu! Over here!

00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:58.816
Aah!

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.988
Hey.
You skip your interview again?

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:07.158
If only reality could be reset.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.458
Arisu!

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.235
Are you trying to get killed out there?

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.655
Where are they shooting from, anyway?

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:54.914
Huh. He must be the King of Spades.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.983
Take this. A good luck charm.

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.862
An explosive? You made this?

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:51.531
Just use it if you have to.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.535
Arisu! Now's our chance!

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.205
Let's go!

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.752
- Arisu?
- He's still alive!

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:08.089
Hey! You okay?

00:09:19.183 --> 00:09:20.851
The King of Spades is here.

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:25.982
Come on!

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.651
Hang in there! Get up!

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:43.249
You all right, huh?

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.549
Hey! You two okay? You hurt?

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.262
Go! Go! Run!

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.267
The King of Spades is

00:10:02.643 --> 00:10:04.103
just one guy.

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:08.274
We're pinned down here!

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:10.151
If we step out, he'll get us!

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:12.903
Huh?

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:21.412
Get in!

00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:22.413
Tatta!

00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:24.123
- Don't just stand there!
- Ann!

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:31.797
Run, Chishiya!

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.509
That's bad. Get going!

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:36.636
- Drive!
- Okay!

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:39.180
Chishiya!

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:57.281
Okay! We're safe for now.

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:59.158
You think Chishiya's okay?

00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:00.701
He can take care of himself.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:05.039
What kind of game is this, guys?
No rules. I mean, we didn't even register.

00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:08.000
- We just take the bad guys down, right?
- And how many are there?

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.418
There's just the one.

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.463
There's only one King of Spades.

00:11:12.963 --> 00:11:15.299
He's like the boss
of the physical challenges.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.969
During the attack,
the blimp was flying around.

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:22.223
Maybe the battlefield
spans the whole city this time.

00:11:22.306 --> 00:11:24.600
How are we supposed to fight them
without a weapon?

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.478
This next stage,
they really leveled up, huh?

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.314
The next stage.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:35.486
Let's have some fun! All of us together!

00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:37.905
I mean, who is Mira? Is she human?

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:39.657
I don't know.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.119
All I can say
is she might be one of the game masters.

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:45.538
Mira? Game master?

00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:48.040
If we're right about the King of Spades,

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.502
it's possible each suit has its own
game master at the top.

00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:55.548
We defeat all four,
we complete the next stage.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.508
We beat the bosses.

00:11:57.591 --> 00:11:58.759
Then what?

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.052
We get to go home?

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:03.973
I'm not sure yet.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:06.726
But that's our best chance to survive.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.068
Where are you even taking us, man?

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:18.946
What? I'm following that car in front.

00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:22.408
- What? Is that a good idea? Who are they?
- Where should we go, then?

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:25.745
Let's just be cool.
We escaped from the game and we're fine.

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.788
That was not a game, Yui!

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:31.292
What? We need a plan so we can win.

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:32.460
We can't run away.

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:35.504
That's not a bad idea. We've still got
plenty of days on our visas.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:36.589
That's true.

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:39.675
- We hide until one of the others wins.
- Ooh! Yeah.

00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:58.235
Just because
we get through all the face cards safely,

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.404
that doesn't mean we get to go back home.

00:13:01.071 --> 00:13:03.908
You don't believe
Hatter's bullshit now, do you?

00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:07.995
Yeah, but the next stage did start after
we got 40 different cards, like he said.

00:13:09.246 --> 00:13:12.166
None of us knew
what was going on when we got here.

00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:16.587
We figured out that winning games extended
our visas by the number of days on a card.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.256
If our visas run out,
we're killed by a laser.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.091
According to Hatter,

00:13:21.717 --> 00:13:25.971
collecting a whole deck of cards
would allow us to return home.

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:29.099
The rules at least make sense.

00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:31.894
You just want it to be true.

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:34.605
No, it's more than that.
There's a pattern.

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:38.692
It seemed crazy,
but there were always rules.

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:50.871
Hey, there's some Beach guys there.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.626
Tatta! Go!

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:56.961
Aah! Hold on!

00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:58.420
Tatta!

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:19.149
Hey! Tatta! Drive better!

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:20.776
I can't!

00:14:25.447 --> 00:14:26.365
Let me drive now.

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:28.075
- Eh?
- Now! Move!

00:14:28.158 --> 00:14:29.827
- Hey, careful. Shit!
- Move!

00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:34.498
Hang on.

00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:07.049
He's not there!

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:09.176
Hey. Nice one!

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.098
He's still there!

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.874
Hey, Ann! Where are you taking us?

00:16:57.558 --> 00:16:58.434
Oh, shit!

00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:34.511
Hey, you guys okay?

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.723
Holy shit! Did you see that?

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:41.101
Anyone get hurt?

00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:42.853
Yeah, I twisted my neck.

00:17:43.353 --> 00:17:44.813
I broke a nail.

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.231
Oh shit--

00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:03.290
Run!

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:09.797
They're--

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.844
I can't do this!

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:18.806
- I can't!
- If you stay here, you'll die. Come on.

00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:21.892
Even if I keep running,
there's always gonna be more!

00:18:21.975 --> 00:18:23.352
I can't do it!

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:07.563
I don't hear any more gunfire.
We should be safe for a while.

00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:11.567
- We can hide here.
- Good.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.277
I hope Chishiya's okay.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.695
And Ann, too.

00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:18.615
Oh, I'm sure they're fine.
I mean, they're, like, super smart.

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:19.658
You're right.

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:21.368
If we're staying here,

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:24.288
we'll have to go out
and scavenge some supplies.

00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:25.372
Water, food.

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:26.874
Mm-hmm.

00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:30.502
Oh man, this sucks. Do we have to, though?

00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:34.381
The longer we wait,
the more likely it is that he'll show up.

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.925
Let's go find some food.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.470
And I'll… I'll go find us a ride.

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:42.598
Coming with me?

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:43.724
What?

00:19:43.807 --> 00:19:45.934
Well, there's a place near here.

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:47.811
Okay, fine.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.568
We won't be long.
You'd better bring back something good.

00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:56.069
- We will.
- Here.

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:57.279
Oh, cool.

00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:59.781
- Okay, let's go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.367
Let me guess. You've never had
a hot girl on your arm before?

00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:04.745
- Come on.
- Sure I have. Shut up!

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:15.172
Okay, this is the spot.
Nice, right?

00:20:15.255 --> 00:20:18.217
Yeah, nice.
Lots of old cars. Cool.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.594
Hey!
They're not old, they're classic.

00:20:20.677 --> 00:20:21.929
Who cares?

00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:29.895
Wait. Are you kidding me?

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:32.940
Holy shit!

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:35.150
Just look at her curves! Oh!

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.819
Dude, don't be weird. It's just a car.

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:40.405
Whoa! Have you ever seen
something this hot?

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:42.366
That's so gross.

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.830
You know, I realized the other day,

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.917
rich people are probably the ones
who are suffering the most now.

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:56.171
Everything they built, that mattered
to them, it's all worthless now.

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.465
You're right.

00:20:59.174 --> 00:21:00.592
I guess I'm lucky, then.

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.262
Don't have to worry about rent anymore.

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:07.266
Yeah, me too. No more credit card
interest payments either.

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:13.897
You know what?

00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:20.904
Even with all the bills and payments,
I still want to go home.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.201
Yeah, me too.

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:57.232
{\an8}YAKISOBA KORE! BAN
SHORTCAKE FLAVOR

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:02.446
Cake-flavored yakisoba?

00:22:03.196 --> 00:22:05.615
Oh, it's just like the one
in the commercial!

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:07.951
Oh, yeah!

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:11.163
What are you doing there?
You know how gross those flavors turn out?

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:14.458
Oh, I beg to differ!

00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:15.917
Mm.

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.169
You're such a virgin.

00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:19.296
Yo, that is so uncalled-for.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.257
- Hey, you better eat it all.
- Oh, for sure.

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:23.884
- All of it.
- I won't have any problem.

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:25.344
- You sure?
- None. Arisu will help.

00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:26.303
Come on, seriously?

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:39.274
Come on, seriously?

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.505
Cash or credit?

00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:08.428
That's good.
I haven't heard that in a long time.

00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:10.514
Here.

00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:16.812
Is this stuff good?

00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:19.147
Mm-hmm. I think so.

00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:21.191
Hmm.

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:25.362
How many chopsticks would you like?

00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:28.281
I'll take four sets, please.

00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:29.533
Of course, sir.

00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:35.122
Thank you very much,
and I hope you have a wonderful day.

00:23:35.872 --> 00:23:38.750
What was-- Your voice went up,
like, a whole octave there.

00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:42.129
But it makes you wanna buy more, right?

00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:45.841
Yeah, I bet a ton of guys
would have come in for you.

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:47.008
With that smile.

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:49.344
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:54.015
Hey, are you blushing?

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:56.893
No. I'm used to it.

00:23:57.644 --> 00:23:58.562
Really?

00:24:06.736 --> 00:24:09.448
I always wanted to work
at a convenience store.

00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:11.074
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

00:24:11.908 --> 00:24:13.994
The barcodes. I like scanning.

00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:17.414
You know the ones
who could scan real well?

00:24:17.497 --> 00:24:19.249
- I really admired them.
- Ah, yeah.

00:24:19.332 --> 00:24:20.500
And here you are, sir.

00:24:22.836 --> 00:24:25.630
I can't wait
to get back to our world.

00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:30.427
Eating yakisoba, AC on full blast,

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.512
sitting with your best friends,

00:24:33.346 --> 00:24:35.640
reading all the new manga
when they come out.

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:49.654
Stop doin' that, man.

00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:51.781
- Creepy smiling makes me wanna hurl.
- Mmm, mmm.

00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:53.617
Yeah, stop.

00:24:54.618 --> 00:24:56.953
- Look at this right here. See?
- Huh? Hm.

00:24:57.037 --> 00:25:00.207
The look on her face.
Her breasts, are you seeing them?

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.500
She's a total ten, bro!

00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:05.420
Manga magazines should be
about the manga, not the models.

00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:08.215
- That's not true.
- What are you talking about? Let me check.

00:25:09.966 --> 00:25:12.177
- You see? She's hot.
- You hearing this?

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.470
- Karube.
- What was that?

00:25:13.553 --> 00:25:14.554
- Check it out.
- Good stuff.

00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:15.805
- What?
- Look, here.

00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:16.765
- You see?
- Arisu.

00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:20.435
You keep saying stupid shit like this,
you'll catch the virgin.

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:22.062
- Wait, what?
- Oh, no, not the virgin!

00:25:22.145 --> 00:25:24.022
- Virgin isn't a disease!
- Oh, no!

00:25:24.105 --> 00:25:25.649
- Damn, you've got it now!
- I guess I did.

00:25:25.732 --> 00:25:27.192
- Wait! I'm already a virgin!
- Oh shit!

00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:29.236
- Oh, now we're teaming up!
- I'm gonna get you…

00:25:34.574 --> 00:25:36.826
Man, those were some good times.

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:44.501
Usagi…

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:50.090
We're gonna make it back to our world.

00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:00.183
What's wrong?

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:16.575
KENICHIRO SHIBASAKI ATTEMPTS SUICIDE
OVER FALSE ARTICLE

00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:19.578
Dad…

00:26:23.873 --> 00:26:25.500
Mr. Usagi?

00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:27.085
Do you have any comment?

00:26:29.713 --> 00:26:33.383
A mountain climber has
gone missing while climbing Mt. Tanigawa

00:26:33.466 --> 00:26:35.802
on the border between Gunma and Niigata…

00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:36.928
AN OXYGEN TANK WAS USED

00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:38.722
"SOLO NO-OXYGEN ASCENT"
WAS IT ALL A HOAX!?

00:26:38.805 --> 00:26:40.932
…the man is famed climber
Shigenori Usagi

00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:44.060
whose accomplishments include
climbing Mt. Everest and as a guide…

00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:46.313
SHIGENORI USAGI:
SUICIDE AFTER SUSPICIONS OF DECEIT?

00:26:46.396 --> 00:26:47.564
SUICIDE?

00:26:47.647 --> 00:26:49.983
…continue to conduct
ground and air searches,

00:26:50.066 --> 00:26:51.985
but so far have not turned up anything…

00:26:52.068 --> 00:26:54.321
There are no leads
in the search for Usagi,

00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:56.740
who went missing climbing Mt. Tanigawa.

00:26:56.823 --> 00:26:58.158
Usagi?

00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:04.164
Uh, what is it?

00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:10.587
Arisu…

00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:15.925
Did you really love your life so much?

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:18.094
Huh?

00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:24.684
I lost my dad…

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.607
right before all this.

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:37.530
They called him a liar.

00:27:41.284 --> 00:27:43.828
They harassed him too,
never left him alone.

00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:46.956
He went for a climb.

00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:53.421
And he never came back.

00:27:55.048 --> 00:27:56.549
That was the last I heard.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.725
But he'd been out so many times.

00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:12.565
And it wasn't a tough mountain at all.

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:17.195
It's impossible,
that's what I told myself.

00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:20.407
But now…

00:28:21.991 --> 00:28:24.244
After living here, I understand.

00:28:28.581 --> 00:28:29.749
He hated this world.

00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:34.713
And he wanted…

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:40.510
He hoped he could find a different one.

00:28:44.472 --> 00:28:46.558
I never thought about that before.

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:53.273
And that's…

00:28:55.316 --> 00:28:56.860
That's how I feel, too.

00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:01.906
I didn't realize
how much I hated our world.

00:29:05.326 --> 00:29:07.579
If we went back, I'd still hate it there.

00:29:15.962 --> 00:29:17.547
I'm sorry. I…

00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:22.010
Getting back is something
everyone else wants.

00:29:31.978 --> 00:29:32.937
Usagi.

00:29:35.148 --> 00:29:36.733
I know how you feel.

00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:39.402
I do.

00:29:43.323 --> 00:29:45.074
I hated so much of my life.

00:29:45.825 --> 00:29:47.202
The world was shit.

00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:50.163
But now, I don't know.

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:52.624
Since coming here,

00:29:54.083 --> 00:29:55.752
I wanna try again.

00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.631
I wanna be a better person.

00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:07.764
I'll protect you.

00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:09.849
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:13.436
Let's go back together.

00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:28.117
I'm sorry.

00:30:32.372 --> 00:30:34.082
Everyone says it, Arisu.

00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:37.335
That they know how I feel.

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:41.172
That I should just forget the past
and be happy.

00:30:47.804 --> 00:30:50.390
But it's not so easy
to forget.

00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:54.060
Even you…

00:30:56.604 --> 00:30:59.023
I don't know
what you've been through either.

00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:06.906
If someone understands me or not,
it doesn't make a difference.

00:31:09.576 --> 00:31:10.577
It's just…

00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:17.458
if somebody gave me the chance
to go back there…

00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:21.254
to that world…

00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:29.554
I really don't think that I would.

00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:33.057
Staying here won't change that.

00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:34.475
Usagi…

00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:48.907
We should go.

00:31:50.783 --> 00:31:52.076
Everyone's waiting.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.951
Hey, hey! Arisu! Usagi! Get in!

00:32:33.826 --> 00:32:36.955
- We're exposed in this thing.
- It's the only one I could start.

00:32:37.038 --> 00:32:39.707
You are such a liar.
I watched you fall in love with it.

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:41.459
It was so gross the way you felt it up.

00:32:41.542 --> 00:32:43.795
- Said it was sexy…
- I said I liked its curves.

00:32:43.878 --> 00:32:45.505
Dude, that's so gross.

00:32:45.588 --> 00:32:48.091
What do you mean, gross?
I like the car.

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:52.178
Get in.

00:32:57.934 --> 00:32:59.936
Arisu?

00:33:00.853 --> 00:33:01.896
Uh, yeah.

00:34:06.836 --> 00:34:09.130
The King of Spades
is getting closer.

00:34:10.256 --> 00:34:13.634
It's just like you said.
His arena is the whole city.

00:34:16.345 --> 00:34:19.974
That's not good.
We gotta stay ahead of him, keep running.

00:34:22.643 --> 00:34:25.313
There's another way
we can stay off his radar.

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:26.939
What's that?

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.485
There's other games we can join, right?

00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:31.861
Huh?

00:34:33.946 --> 00:34:36.074
Put yourself in their shoes for a sec.

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:39.202
I wouldn't want my game interfered with.

00:34:39.952 --> 00:34:42.663
So they have some kind of agreement,
is that it?

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:46.167
Don't interfere with each other,
be polite.

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:51.422
Each game so far has had rules.
Very strict rules.

00:34:52.298 --> 00:34:54.258
If another game got mixed in,

00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:56.844
it would completely ruin it.

00:34:57.637 --> 00:34:58.971
But, like…

00:34:59.722 --> 00:35:02.058
What if I don't wanna play anymore?

00:35:02.141 --> 00:35:06.145
We were forced into
the King of Spades' game, like it or not.

00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:08.773
We can keep hiding, sure.

00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:11.192
But eventually, he'll find us and kill us,

00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:14.028
or our visas will run out,
and then, pyeow!

00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:16.447
If we keep playing, though,

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:19.283
we'll be able to get more information.

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:22.120
Find out from the game masters
what this place is.

00:35:22.662 --> 00:35:24.497
Or why we're here.

00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:27.667
We need more answers.

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.629
Or everyone else died for nothing.

00:35:43.432 --> 00:35:44.809
Why don't we vote on it?

00:35:47.186 --> 00:35:49.021
I'm with Arisu on this.

00:35:51.607 --> 00:35:52.733
Oh shit.

00:35:54.277 --> 00:35:56.571
All right. Count me in.

00:35:58.239 --> 00:35:59.157
Usagi?

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:04.662
It's majority rules.

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:06.622
You have your answer.

00:36:09.417 --> 00:36:12.086
So, which game first? What do you think?

00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:20.428
The furthest one we can see
is here, along the harbor.

00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:22.722
The King of Clubs.

00:36:23.472 --> 00:36:26.225
You're picking a King? You're joking?

00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:29.395
A King would probably
have more key information.

00:36:29.478 --> 00:36:31.898
You've got guts, Arisu.

00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:35.651
And besides,
Club games are about teamwork.

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:38.487
So we'll have a chance to win.

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:42.533
- With this group, for sure!
- Ah! Yeah!

00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:44.118
I'm not counting you in that.

00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:46.162
- Hey!
- Kidding!

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.446
What's that?

00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:18.045
NO WEAPONS ALLOWED

00:38:18.754 --> 00:38:21.090
PARTICIPANTS: FIVE PLAYERS
PLEASE PUT ON BRACELETS AND WAIT

00:38:21.173 --> 00:38:22.216
Bracelets?

00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:25.845
It says we need five players.

00:38:26.345 --> 00:38:27.847
But there's only four.

00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:31.851
Five, actually.

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:38.274
Niragi?

00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:40.151
It's been a while.

00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:44.697
What?

00:38:45.364 --> 00:38:46.407
You're still alive?

00:38:49.076 --> 00:38:51.537
Team up with him? I don't think so.

00:38:52.204 --> 00:38:54.123
He'll sabotage us, for sure.

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.960
I bet he's already got
a plan to screw us over.

00:38:58.044 --> 00:39:00.296
The bracelet's not comin' off now.

00:39:02.715 --> 00:39:04.967
All I wanna do is enjoy the game.

00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:08.804
If you're not interested in playin',

00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:11.640
you'd better get outta here, huh?

00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:17.730
Usagi?

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:20.608
I don't care what he wants.

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:29.867
If we don't join the game,

00:39:30.576 --> 00:39:31.827
we'll be gunned down.

00:39:33.662 --> 00:39:34.955
And that's it.

00:39:36.999 --> 00:39:39.460
I'd rather fight here
than die like an animal.

00:39:44.965 --> 00:39:45.883
Me too.

00:39:50.179 --> 00:39:51.472
I wanna know why.

00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:10.616
You two are idiots.

00:40:11.826 --> 00:40:13.494
Don't say I didn't warn you.

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:20.292
Hey, don't slow us down.

00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:23.796
This game is about working together.

00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:28.551
And I'm pretty sure you're the slow one.

00:40:36.892 --> 00:40:39.186
Registration is now closed.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.439
The game will now commence.

00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:48.631
What is this place?

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:57.431
The King of Club's team
is now entering the field.

00:42:19.411 --> 00:42:20.538
Welcome…

00:42:22.665 --> 00:42:24.416
to our game field.

00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:28.170
I am the King of Clubs,

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.506
Kyuma.

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:42.351
- Uh…
- Uh…

00:42:45.312 --> 00:42:48.148
Okay, let me introduce everyone.

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:50.150
First we have Shitara.

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:55.322
Uta.

00:42:56.782 --> 00:42:57.741
Maki.

00:42:59.034 --> 00:43:00.202
Goken.

00:43:03.622 --> 00:43:04.540
Pleasure.

00:43:08.377 --> 00:43:10.129
That's all the reaction I get?

00:43:10.796 --> 00:43:12.464
I think you're weirding them out.

00:43:12.548 --> 00:43:13.966
Put some damn pants on.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.302
What? Not a chance!

00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:18.971
Nudism is an upstanding practice.

00:43:19.054 --> 00:43:21.724
A social movement
with hundreds of years of history!

00:43:22.975 --> 00:43:25.477
Clothing is a social construct.

00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:27.730
No biological necessity.

00:43:28.647 --> 00:43:31.108
Humans should be bare and raw.

00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:33.193
After all, it's only natural.

00:43:34.486 --> 00:43:36.405
What's the deal with this guy?

00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:39.992
So this is the King of Clubs?

00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:41.910
Out of his damn mind.

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:47.374
Listen, we don't care about that.
Just tell us who you are.

00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:51.670
Who are we?

00:43:52.713 --> 00:43:54.590
We are the citizens of this country.

00:43:57.551 --> 00:43:58.719
Citizens?

00:43:59.219 --> 00:44:01.305
Sure. Citizens.
