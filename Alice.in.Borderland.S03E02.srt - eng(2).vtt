00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.925
The game will now commence.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.351
"The game"?

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.064
What game?

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:28.361
What "game" do they mean?

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.908
Where… did everyone go?

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.870
Shinagawa Station was empty too.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.832
Shit.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:43.877
I'm trippin' hard.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.968
The game is Fortunes.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:00.685
Test your luck by drawing ten fortunes.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.312
FORTUNES

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:09.903
To win, decipher the meaning
of the fortunes and survive to the end.

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:14.032
However, only one draw
is allowed per person.

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:18.745
There is a one-minute time limit per draw.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:23.124
Game start.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.587
Is there some sort of festival today?

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:33.927
The announcement mentioned
"survive to the end."

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.386
Does that mean

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.680
we die if we're wrong?

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:39.849
No way.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.185
Sounds fun to me.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.740
He's on drugs.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:58.701
Here goes!

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.963
Seventeen.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.675
Let's see…

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:16.678
Seventeen!

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.767
First draw. Begin.

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.069
"Great luck."

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.823
"Everything you do will go well."

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:39.242
-Check it out!
-Nice one!

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.368
Right?

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:42.912
We don't know whether that's good yet.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:54.007
Maybe nothing happens with "great luck."

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.636
Okay, then let's keep drawing.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.721
What?

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:01.764
We're doing this?

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.808
I wanna try.

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:05.435
Go ahead.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.572
Twenty-one.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.202
Second draw. Begin.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:26.873
"Good luck."

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.251
"Wishes gradually come true.
Marriage prospects are good."

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:33.796
"Study hard with peace of mind.
West is unlucky."

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:39.052
There's a math problem.

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:41.471
May we see?

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.811
Should we solve it?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.023
-Your answer, please.
-Fifteen.

00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:54.567
-Fifteen?
-Fifteen.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:55.735
Isn't it 18?

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:57.946
-It's five.
-Fourteen!

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.240
-Which one?
-Come on. There's no time!

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.491
Ten more seconds.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.160
The answer is 18!

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.204
-I said 15.
-That's totally wrong.

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.706
The answer is 15.

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.041
Told you.

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.751
-See?
-Sorry.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.254
If you answer incorrectly,

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.632
the difference will determine
the number of flaming arrows.

00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:19.968
Please be careful.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:21.719
Flaming arrows?

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.857
What the hell?

00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:04.906
Please.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:12.789
Forty-five.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:14.999
Forty-five…

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.547
Third draw. Begin.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:23.299
"Moderate luck."

00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:25.259
And the problem?

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:31.599
"How many people does it take
for there to be at least a 50% chance

00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:33.768
that two share the same birthday?"

00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:36.062
"One, 23."

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:37.855
"Two, 78."

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.857
"Three, 183."

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.151
"Four, 365."

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.986
I've got no idea.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.696
It's a probability problem.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.782
It's probably more than 100.

00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:49.659
It's probably 183, right?

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.494
I think it's 23.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:52.995
Yeah, 23.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.622
Maybe it's 183?

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:56.958
Twenty seconds left.

00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:57.875
Okay.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:00.878
The answer is

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:03.506
number two, 78.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.091
What? Why?

00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:06.676
I took the middle ground!

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:10.763
-Please!
-The answer is number one, 23 people.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.557
-See?
-Difference, 55.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.530
I'm sorry!

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.741
Fourth draw. Begin.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:34.203
"How long does it take
for blood pumped from the heart

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:38.166
to make one round trip
through the entire body?"

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.751
"One, five seconds."

00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:42.837
"Two, 30 seconds."

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.256
"Three, 80 seconds."

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.009
Number three, 80 seconds!

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:52.054
The answer is number two, 30 seconds.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.764
Difference, 50.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:09.322
"Fifty zoo animals
flipped over sequentially."

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:12.033
"What was the lion's number
in the sequence?"

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.410
Is that it?

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.536
A riddle?

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:17.747
Forty-seventh!

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.667
The answer is 17th.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:22.627
Why?

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:27.465
"Lion" flipped upside down is "No. 17."

00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:28.466
What the hell?

00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:30.134
Difference, 30.

00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:39.519
"The Roman numeral I is one,
V is five, and X is ten."

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.979
"What does L equal?"

00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:44.232
One hundred!

00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:47.068
The answer is 50.

00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:48.027
Sorry!

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.320
Difference, 50.

00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:55.618
Difference, 55.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.469
Eighth draw. Begin.

00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:47.795
Now I remember.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.923
-Arisu, live on for us.
-Karube!

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.012
That's right.

00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:01.058
I won a bunch of games here.

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:08.774
All right!

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.193
I'm gonna draw "great luck"!

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.612
You can do it!

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.288
Ninth draw. Begin.

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:23.789
"Minor luck."

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.542
I'm toast if it's a thinking problem.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:29.211
At least it's not "bad luck."
What's the problem?

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.129
Let's see…

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:36.677
"Milk is made from nutrients
in a cow's blood."

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:41.682
"How many liters of blood
are needed to make one liter of milk?"

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:43.893
Huh?

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:45.645
Anyone know?

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:47.813
Who the hell would know that?

00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:49.231
I don't know.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.650
-Twenty seconds left.
-Answer!

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:53.235
Don't rush her. It makes it hard to think.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.695
There's no time! Hurry!

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.572
I don't know stuff like this!

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:57.907
Guess a number!

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.662
Ten seconds left.

00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:05.539
The answer is…

00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:08.834
two liters.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.214
The answer is 450 liters.

00:11:13.297 --> 00:11:15.049
450 liters?

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:16.717
That much?

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:18.427
It's one liter of milk!

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.389
-I'm sorry!
-Difference, 448.

00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:24.767
No way!

00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:49.583
I'm sorry!

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:52.044
Never mind! Help me with this!

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:53.754
Shit!

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.843
It's too freakin' hot!

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.344
Now then…

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:03.389
This is gonna hurt.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:08.978
Sorry about this.

00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:16.944
-Huh?
-You okay?

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.363
Don't pass out!

00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:21.532
All right.

00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:25.244
You know first aid?

00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:28.330
Only 'cause I can't see a doctor
without getting arrested.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:31.375
That should do it. You okay?

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.806
-I'm burning up!
-The tenth draw's next.

00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:48.017
The last one, right?

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.186
We'll win if you draw.

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:52.813
Please.

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:54.648
Got it.

00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:58.944
I can't take it anymore!

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.284
Tenth draw. Begin.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:15.336
NUMBER 58
EXTREME BAD LUCK

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:17.963
Look at you.

00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:21.091
Well done.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:23.594
-Sorry.
-What's the problem?

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:30.476
"What is the world population
in billions?"

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.061
Huh?

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:37.775
I heard the world's population
increases by 80 million each year.

00:13:37.858 --> 00:13:40.194
It was about 7.88 billion a few years ago.

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:43.906
A wrong answer means
hundreds of millions of arrows.

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:45.616
No way that's possible.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:47.868
Twenty seconds left.

00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:57.211
Ten seconds left.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.840
7.9 billion.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.469
The answer is eight billion.

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.305
-Seriously?
-Off by 100 million.

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:12.101
That's impossible!
Where would that many arrows even…

00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:25.281
No way.

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:29.118
A hundred million arrows.

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.828
What are we gonna do?

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:32.621
What do we do?

00:14:33.414 --> 00:14:35.749
Think.

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:41.505
Decipher the meaning of the fortunes…

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.842
"Study hard with peace of mind.
West is unlucky."

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:47.386
DIRECTIONAL FORTUNE CHART

00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:48.429
WEST

00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:52.016
Direction.

00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:53.142
Huh?

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:54.059
What?

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:57.229
Could the fortune directions
tell us how to escape?

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.815
-I threw mine away!
-What's your direction?

00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:01.984
"West is unlucky."

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:03.944
The arrows came from that way.

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:05.863
Anyone have a compass?

00:15:05.946 --> 00:15:08.782
-Who the hell would?
-Mine says northeast is unlucky.

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:11.493
-Arrows came from that way!
-Mine says north is unlucky.

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:12.870
Southeast is unlucky for me.

00:15:12.953 --> 00:15:14.622
-Mine says east.
-Mine is southwest.

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.249
-Mine is south.
-It's blank on my fortune.

00:15:18.792 --> 00:15:20.502
What does "great luck" say?

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.714
I said I threw it away!

00:15:23.797 --> 00:15:24.632
-Huh?
-What?!

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:25.716
The arrows!

00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:28.093
Take cover!

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.888
Northwest.

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:34.808
-What?
-It's the only one missing.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:38.938
The "great luck" fortune was northwest.
That might be how we escape.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.149
-Come on! Hurry!
-Hurry!

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:54.203
Stop.

00:15:55.162 --> 00:15:57.539
Now what? There's nothing here!

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.249
There must be something.

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:00.376
There's a well!

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:04.922
It's full of dirt!

00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:12.471
The entrance had a long, steep stairway.

00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:13.555
So what?!

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:14.640
That means

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.393
within this compound,

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:19.979
there must be…

00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:26.819
a tunnel!

00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:34.076
Here it comes.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:38.956
What the hell?

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.293
How do we even survive that?

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:45.796
-Some help here!
-Okay!

00:16:49.883 --> 00:16:51.343
It's too late.

00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:10.529
A tunnel.

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:15.451
-Get in!
-Hurry!

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:33.218
Come on! Hurry!

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.035
This way.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.296
Game cleared.

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:13.425
We made it.

00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:50.712
PROCEED 17 KM NORTHEAST
THE "GAME" STARTS AT SUNDOWN TOMORROW

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:52.005
Another game?

00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:57.344
And if we refuse to go?

00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:01.306
Yeah, let's just not go.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.976
But if we don't go, then…

00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:11.066
There's no escaping the games.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.528
So this means…

00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:42.658
Yeah.

00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:46.453
We've been here before.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.033
Big Sister!

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:10.579
"Big Sister"?

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:12.664
Found something good.

00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:14.041
Here.

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.085
-What's this?
-A cane.

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.421
Thought it might help you walk.

00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:20.505
Thanks.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.549
It's so shiny.

00:22:22.632 --> 00:22:23.884
Yeah, glam gal style.

00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:30.891
Hey, Arisu. I found tons of stuff.

00:22:30.974 --> 00:22:32.267
Wow. That's great.

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:35.729
-There's food too.
-Great.

00:22:39.232 --> 00:22:41.234
His eyes gave me chills.

00:22:42.944 --> 00:22:45.614
Like a creepy feeling he wasn't human.

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.451
That man…

00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:53.830
I think I met him too.

00:22:55.582 --> 00:22:56.583
For real?

00:22:57.542 --> 00:22:58.919
About two years ago,

00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:03.590
I… went and did this.

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:06.301
You poor thing.

00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:12.349
I was found unconscious, but I survived.

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:14.726
But I was

00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:18.730
still broken from all the bullying.

00:23:20.607 --> 00:23:25.153
I continued being a recluse.
Nothing changed for me.

00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:27.864
And then…

00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:30.784
He gave you that card.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.494
Yeah.

00:23:33.286 --> 00:23:37.290
I think I met him before coming here too.

00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:39.042
Where?

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.462
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:23:43.213 --> 00:23:45.549
I was invited to this healing circle…

00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:47.801
"Healing circle"?

00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:51.888
For housewives with family problems.

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:54.599
Those kinds of groups exist.

00:23:55.684 --> 00:24:00.188
It was almost like he hypnotized me.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.651
So this guy is the Joker?

00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:12.742
We beat all the face cards
at their respective games,

00:24:14.327 --> 00:24:16.163
but we never battled the Joker.

00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:22.377
So does that mean
we're up against the Joker now?

00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:24.212
Most likely.

00:24:25.422 --> 00:24:28.967
The only thing I know is
we have something in common.

00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:32.637
We've all been here before.

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:34.222
Right.

00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:37.851
I'm starting to remember.

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:42.522
I once played games here too.

00:24:44.024 --> 00:24:47.777
I had a heart attack
while supervising club activities

00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:51.031
at the school I worked at.

00:24:51.907 --> 00:24:53.700
I was attacked by a stalker.

00:24:57.746 --> 00:24:59.956
For me, it was the Shibuya meteorite.

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:01.833
But the games…

00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:06.254
I don't wanna remember them.

00:25:25.106 --> 00:25:27.984
Arisu, have you also been here before?

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:31.404
Yeah.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.228
Unbelievable.

00:26:03.853 --> 00:26:07.148
He came here of his own free will
to get his wife back?

00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:09.234
You poor thing.

00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:11.736
-You've never known love, have you?
-Huh?

00:26:12.362 --> 00:26:15.740
A husband's duty is to cherish his wife.

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:20.078
But what are the odds
of finding his wife here?

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:23.623
Well, I'd say about 5%.

00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:26.293
-There's zero chance.
-Quiet!

00:26:27.794 --> 00:26:30.672
And we might all die in the next game.

00:26:56.197 --> 00:27:03.204
"GAME" ARENA THIS WAY

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.388
Man, this is creepy.

00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:41.826
There are other participants?

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:47.374
The game is Zombie Hunt.

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:50.669
Zombies?

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:53.046
Here are the rules.

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:59.135
Each of you will be dealt seven cards.

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:03.598
Use your cards to play one-on-one games

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:08.353
at the special tables
throughout the facility.

00:28:15.402 --> 00:28:19.906
Play cards of the same suit
from your hand.

00:28:21.783 --> 00:28:25.203
The player with the higher hand wins.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:30.458
The winner takes one card from the loser.

00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:36.715
The higher hand wins.

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:39.050
Easy-peasy.

00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:41.720
Where do the zombies come in?

00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:46.474
This game has
three kinds of special cards.

00:28:47.142 --> 00:28:48.685
The first is…

00:28:50.687 --> 00:28:51.813
Zombie cards.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.399
Now I see.

00:28:56.985 --> 00:29:01.072
Only one person per team
will be dealt a Zombie card.

00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:10.915
The Zombie beats all other cards,
no matter how high they are.

00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:14.836
The loser gets infected…

00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:19.632
and a Zombie card is added to their hand.

00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:24.637
The card that prevents
zombies from multiplying is

00:29:26.014 --> 00:29:27.307
the Shotgun card.

00:29:28.224 --> 00:29:31.686
You can kill a zombie with this card.

00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:37.358
Each player will have one Shotgun card.

00:29:40.153 --> 00:29:44.783
You can use it to kill a zombie even if
their Zombie card isn't on the table.

00:29:45.366 --> 00:29:48.244
So zombies risk getting killed.

00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:51.706
The Shotgun card disappears after one use.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.250
It has no effect on humans.

00:29:55.627 --> 00:30:00.173
For those who want a peaceful resolution,
there's the Vaccine card.

00:30:01.257 --> 00:30:05.637
Vaccine cards will be
randomly distributed.

00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:12.310
Playing the Vaccine card
nullifies a Zombie card on the table…

00:30:14.854 --> 00:30:17.565
and turns the zombie back into a human.

00:30:19.526 --> 00:30:23.696
However, you cannot use
the Vaccine card on yourself.

00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:30.078
Use these two cards
to prevent zombies from multiplying.

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:34.707
The game ends after 20 rounds.

00:30:35.208 --> 00:30:40.171
If you run out of number cards
during the 20 rounds,

00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:41.506
it's game over.

00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:47.804
Whichever side, zombies or humans,
has more members at the end wins.

00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:50.557
LARGER SIDE AFTER 20 ROUNDS WINS
HUMANS / ZOMBIES

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.393
It's game over
for the side with fewer members.

00:30:55.061 --> 00:31:01.901
Each team will enter the game
via one of the four entrances.

00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:05.280
There are other teams?

00:31:06.739 --> 00:31:10.994
There is also one zombie
on each of the other teams.

00:31:11.077 --> 00:31:12.620
So just four?

00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:17.709
Game start.

00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:20.712
Please take your cards.

00:31:38.187 --> 00:31:39.772
No Zombie, please.

00:31:42.525 --> 00:31:44.736
First round. Begin.

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:48.615
Please choose an opponent
by touching them,

00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:50.867
and then head to a game table.

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:17.936
Please place your cards.

00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:23.024
The numbers on the cards
aren't that important.

00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:28.237
After 20 rounds, all we need is
to have at least one number card.

00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:29.322
Open.

00:32:32.075 --> 00:32:33.034
My bad.

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:35.286
Shit.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.247
We might want to avoid
playing other teams.

00:32:38.331 --> 00:32:42.085
Why not just play among ourselves
and share number cards?

00:32:43.544 --> 00:32:44.587
You're right.

00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:47.382
Second round. Begin.

00:32:47.924 --> 00:32:52.679
The special cards are a problem,
especially the Zombie card.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:55.515
Open.

00:32:57.266 --> 00:32:58.434
I win.

00:32:58.518 --> 00:33:00.269
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:02.981
Kinda cramped here.

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:05.692
There are game tables in the basement.

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:10.154
-Let's set up base there.
-Yeah, looks roomy.

00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:20.123
The humans win if the zombies are
prevented from multiplying for 20 turns.

00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:26.462
There's a zombie on our team, right?

00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:31.634
Whoever it is probably won't tell anyone.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.136
Why not?

00:33:33.219 --> 00:33:37.473
Because if they're exposed,
they might get killed by a Shotgun card.

00:33:37.974 --> 00:33:38.975
Right.

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:42.311
Third round. Begin.

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:44.605
Another team!

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.193
-Touch them!
-Okay.

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.988
Hey there.

00:33:54.907 --> 00:33:55.908
Open.

00:33:56.951 --> 00:33:59.037
To keep zombies from multiplying,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.249
we need to find the players
who were randomly dealt Vaccine cards.

00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:06.878
That will be our key to victory.

00:34:06.961 --> 00:34:07.879
I win.

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:12.341
There doesn't seem to be
a Vaccine card on our team.

00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:18.389
That means there's a good chance
a player on another team has one.

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:47.418
Usagi.

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:05.394
Please choose an opponent
by touching them.

00:35:10.066 --> 00:35:11.275
Can I ask you something?

00:35:12.026 --> 00:35:12.860
What?

00:35:14.403 --> 00:35:16.614
I'm looking for a woman named Usagi.

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:18.908
Have you seen her?

00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:24.205
She has hair about this long
and is about 160 centimeters tall.

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:27.333
There were tons of women like that.

00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:30.545
I see.

00:35:33.339 --> 00:35:34.882
But check this out.

00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:39.220
This Joker stage seems to be a tournament.

00:35:40.513 --> 00:35:44.433
Even if you find her,
you might have to kill each other.

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:50.189
A tournament?

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:55.069
We can't choose the games we play,
and once we get to an arena,

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.407
we meet up with players
who survived other arenas.

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:02.743
I think he's right.

00:36:03.369 --> 00:36:06.622
It's way different
from when I first came here.

00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:09.709
We could choose which games to play.

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:11.460
That's right.

00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:16.674
There will only be a few players left
by the end of the tournament.

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:20.469
Those who survive will likely…

00:36:22.221 --> 00:36:24.307
Have to kill each other.

00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:28.436
Whoa.

00:36:36.611 --> 00:36:40.823
Please choose an opponent
by touching them.

00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:52.251
Please place your cards.

00:36:53.419 --> 00:36:56.964
You've… been infected
by a zombie, haven't you?

00:36:58.341 --> 00:36:59.300
What?

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.387
You haven't looked me in the eye
since you sat down.

00:37:04.472 --> 00:37:08.726
If you wanted to work together and share
number cards, you'd make eye contact.

00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:10.478
Well…

00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:12.688
On top of that,

00:37:13.314 --> 00:37:16.609
you've been playing against the same girl
this whole time.

00:37:17.443 --> 00:37:19.987
But you suddenly chose me for this round.

00:37:20.821 --> 00:37:25.368
So I figured you turned her
into a zombie and then split up.

00:37:26.869 --> 00:37:30.414
Zombies only win
if they infect enough players.

00:37:41.801 --> 00:37:44.303
Making more zombies here
isn't a good idea.

00:37:45.012 --> 00:37:46.264
Zombies get shot.

00:37:47.181 --> 00:37:49.684
But there's no such risk if you're human.

00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:54.105
Everyone on this team
still has a Shotgun card.

00:37:54.897 --> 00:37:58.025
Someone might kill you
the moment you're exposed.

00:37:59.735 --> 00:38:00.611
Listen.

00:38:01.237 --> 00:38:04.073
We'll cure you
once we find a Vaccine card.

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:06.784
Stay with us for now.

00:38:22.258 --> 00:38:23.259
Open.

00:39:02.214 --> 00:39:04.425
Zombies might already be multiplying.

00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:07.094
They're zombies?

00:39:08.054 --> 00:39:09.889
What should we do with them?

00:39:11.098 --> 00:39:13.142
We need to find Vaccine cards.

00:39:14.101 --> 00:39:15.227
Hey.

00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:19.690
Don't overthink it.
We should just kill them.

00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:22.401
We can't simply shoot them.

00:39:22.485 --> 00:39:24.779
We have to prevent zombification.

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:26.364
Any ideas?

00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:30.284
There is one way.

00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:33.496
A way to defend against Zombie cards

00:39:33.579 --> 00:39:36.415
without killing each other.

00:39:42.797 --> 00:39:45.007
-What is it?
-Careful.

00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:47.426
She's not from our team.

00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:50.054
She might be a zombie.

00:39:55.643 --> 00:40:01.482
We form a group that promises to use
the Vaccine card to cure each other.

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:06.737
Even if one of our members
turns into a zombie,

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:09.782
we'll make sure to cure them.

00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:16.414
Then we'll have them tell us
who infected them

00:40:16.497 --> 00:40:19.333
and threaten to shoot whoever that is.

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:24.839
That will scare other zombies
away from our group.

00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:28.384
A pact to use Vaccine cards
to cure each other?

00:40:29.301 --> 00:40:30.511
Will it last?

00:40:32.721 --> 00:40:33.973
Let's say…

00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:37.685
you're a zombie.

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:38.644
Here.

00:40:40.187 --> 00:40:43.774
And say you also have a Vaccine card.

00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:50.114
Then suppose you reveal
that you're a zombie

00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:55.161
and say you'll promise to use
your Vaccine card on him

00:40:55.244 --> 00:40:57.037
if he becomes a zombie.

00:40:58.205 --> 00:41:00.374
See what I'm getting at?

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.377
What?

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:08.799
You've confessed to being a zombie.

00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:12.219
It's like saying, "Kill me anytime."

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:16.724
You mean forming an alliance
by using yourself as a hostage?

00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:17.641
Exactly.

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:21.687
You'll keep your promise
because you don't want to die.

00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:25.191
You're saying,
"You can kill me if I don't keep it."

00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:29.904
The zombie willingly becomes
a hostage for the humans.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:36.243
And this promise is made
with multiple people.

00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:39.371
We create a trust-based group.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:46.003
We promise to use this vaccine
to cure anyone who turns into a zombie.

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:48.672
But there's only one Vaccine card.

00:41:48.756 --> 00:41:52.134
We have to persuade
other Vaccine cardholders to join us.

00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:53.719
Are there enough to go around?

00:41:55.471 --> 00:41:59.725
None of us know
the total number of Vaccine cards.

00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:05.314
We just have to trick
all the other players into believing

00:42:05.397 --> 00:42:08.275
that we have enough to save everyone.

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:13.948
Do that, and zombies won't come near us,

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:17.910
and we can win the game
by increasing our numbers.

00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:24.792
Okay, but is there really anyone
with both a Zombie and a Vaccine card?

00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:27.586
That would be me.

00:42:28.337 --> 00:42:29.338
Huh?

00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:33.050
That's why you approached us?

00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:35.427
Yeah, to make my sales pitch.

00:42:37.846 --> 00:42:39.139
What's your name?

00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:43.310
Rei.

00:42:45.354 --> 00:42:47.064
We'll share the Vaccine card…

00:42:47.147 --> 00:42:49.567
This "barricade of trust" strategy

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:53.028
must first be communicated
to the other teams.

00:42:53.112 --> 00:42:55.739
Zombies will be too scared
to come near us.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:59.785
Because if they use
their Zombie card on us,

00:42:59.868 --> 00:43:03.497
they will be exposed
and risk getting shot.

00:43:04.873 --> 00:43:09.378
We can win if we grow our numbers
with this barricade strategy.

00:43:11.338 --> 00:43:12.256
Okay.

00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:15.301
Count me in.

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:21.265
There's a group in the basement promising
to use Vaccine cards on each other.

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:25.185
Even if you use a Zombie card,
the Vaccine card will cure them.

00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:26.770
That group is trouble.

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:30.441
They keep each other updated
on zombies who came to infect them.

00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:33.277
So if you zombify one of them,

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.071
they'll tell the others,
and you'll get killed.

00:43:36.155 --> 00:43:37.865
Don't tell anyone else,

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:42.036
but I heard a zombie
tried to turn someone from that group,

00:43:42.536 --> 00:43:46.790
got exposed, and ended up being killed.

00:43:47.333 --> 00:43:48.292
For real?

00:43:48.375 --> 00:43:53.088
That group promised to cure each other
with Vaccine cards if they're zombified.

00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:57.051
It might be safer to join them
at this point.

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:58.135
They're bad news.

00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:01.388
Will this barricade of trust really work?

00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:03.349
You'll see.

00:44:05.934 --> 00:44:08.520
We'll gather in the basement
and work it out there.

00:44:09.021 --> 00:44:10.564
Okay, Miyano.

00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:13.192
I have a Vaccine card.

00:44:13.275 --> 00:44:14.985
That makes you the third one.

00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:16.570
Next.

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:21.367
We'll try to play games among our group,
sharing number cards as we go.

00:44:22.034 --> 00:44:25.704
In short, we'll lose on purpose
to those with fewer cards.

00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:29.750
And the winner will take
a lower-number card from the loser.

00:44:32.419 --> 00:44:35.589
And zombies will only play each other.

00:44:36.465 --> 00:44:40.260
That way, we won't have to
kill each other to stop the spread.

00:44:40.886 --> 00:44:43.097
And no one runs out of number cards.

00:44:44.306 --> 00:44:48.268
We'll get more players who have
Vaccine cards if we keep this up.

00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:07.579
It's already the 11th round.

00:45:07.663 --> 00:45:10.541
Maybe we should join that basement group.

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.960
I heard they gathered Vaccine cards.

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.753
Who knows if it's true?

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:28.142
We won't get any more Vaccine cards.

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:31.186
We don't even know how many there are.

00:45:32.646 --> 00:45:35.357
Simply threatening zombies isn't enough.

00:45:35.441 --> 00:45:38.318
There's a way to increase
our odds of survival.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:40.696
How?

00:45:43.365 --> 00:45:45.534
Reduce the number of zombies.

00:45:51.373 --> 00:45:52.833
I get it.

00:45:54.543 --> 00:45:56.378
This dude turned into a zombie.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.381
Put him in there.

00:46:11.977 --> 00:46:15.147
Do you remember who turned you?

00:46:17.107 --> 00:46:18.108
Yeah.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:24.406
We'll kill 'em.

00:46:33.165 --> 00:46:34.166
Hey,

00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:37.753
would you do it?

00:46:40.756 --> 00:46:43.050
We'll guarantee you vaccine priority.

00:46:59.107 --> 00:47:01.068
Please place your cards.

00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:22.548
Open.

00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:45.070
You said you wanted out too!

00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:48.949
Are you gonna shoot me, a blood brother?!

00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:50.075
No, stop!

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.099
Kazuya, you…

00:48:18.478 --> 00:48:19.646
It had to be done.

00:48:22.441 --> 00:48:23.734
This is a game.

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:40.167
Nice work!

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:43.921
You're not some law-abiding chump.

00:48:45.797 --> 00:48:47.174
Take note, everyone.

00:48:48.634 --> 00:48:51.970
Everyone who was zombified
has info on the other zombies.

00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:55.515
Get info from the other teams too.

00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:57.225
How?

00:49:00.812 --> 00:49:02.898
Threaten them with a Shotgun card.

00:49:03.649 --> 00:49:05.025
They'll talk.

00:49:08.195 --> 00:49:11.573
I like your style. Let's keep it up, eh?

00:49:49.444 --> 00:49:54.074
Tell me who the zombies are,
and we'll give you vaccine priority.

00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:58.078
Okay! I'll tell you the ones I know!

00:50:04.793 --> 00:50:07.379
We're dead if they find out we're zombies.

00:50:08.046 --> 00:50:09.381
We have to hide.

00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:10.882
Listen.

00:50:11.758 --> 00:50:14.052
We'll trap them and turn them.

00:50:15.053 --> 00:50:16.847
At this point, anyone will do!

00:50:18.932 --> 00:50:20.392
-Come on.
-Right.

00:50:26.773 --> 00:50:27.649
Open.

00:50:44.958 --> 00:50:46.460
This is not good.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.336
Yeah.

00:50:48.962 --> 00:50:49.963
Don't you care?

00:50:51.465 --> 00:50:55.218
The barricade of trust is holding up.

00:50:57.012 --> 00:50:59.973
The zombies on the other teams
will retaliate.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.607
It's starting to feel like a real game.

00:53:39.299 --> 00:53:42.260
