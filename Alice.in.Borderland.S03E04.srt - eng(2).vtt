00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.477
That means… we wasted another cartridge?

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:23.815
Two cars, both poison,
and one cartridge left.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.901
We can't reach the end.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.373
We're gonna die.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.834
Right?

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.795
We're definitely gonna die now!

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.300
-I'm sorry.
-It's not your fault.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.470
I'm not blaming anyone.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.639
I know it's my own fault!

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:04.773
Why the hell did I bet on your hunch?

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.941
Your father was a fraud!

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.403
I'm so stupid!

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.989
I knew she was the daughter of fraud!

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.492
-Calm down!
-Juri!

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.703
Enough already!

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:21.081
Why?

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.209
Why?!

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.294
Why do I have to die?!

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.726
Excuse me.

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:47.482
We just passed Jimbocho Station,

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.277
so we're near where
the trains run in parallel.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:56.199
If the train we saw earlier
is still traveling at the same speed,

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.619
we'll run side by side!

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.081
What's your point?

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.836
So that's our only option?

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.135
-Jump onto the other train?
-What?

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:18.888
The players in the front car were dead.
No need for cartridges.

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:22.308
The doors are open,
and the poison gas is gone.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:23.393
No way!

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:27.605
We either do nothing and die here
or fight to the end.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.566
That's impossible!

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:33.027
Follow me if you want.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:46.893
Let's do it.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:52.190
Don't be stupid.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.778
Have you lost your mind?
How are you gonna jump across?

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.533
The timing's key!

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:04.953
It's almost here!

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.378
It's okay. You can do it.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.381
You definitely can. Tell yourself that.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.592
I can do it.

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:23.972
-Get up. You can do it.
-I can do it.

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:28.226
There it is.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:43.992
Get ready!

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:50.081
Now!

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:01.509
Here I go!

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.138
Move!

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.480
They're dead because of her!

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:15.898
Move!

00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:18.568
Ryuji!

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.652
Hurry!

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:30.663
Grab him!

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.693
Another train is coming!

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:51.702
Arisu!

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:52.787
Usagi!

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:03.965
Look out!

00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.009
Usagi!

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:08.511
Arisu!

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:10.888
Usagi!

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.615
-She was with some guy.
-Shush!

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.539
This is the end of the line.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.916
Please stop the train.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.168
We gotta stop it!

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.003
How do we do that?

00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:43.963
How the hell would I know?

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:45.131
We're gonna crash!

00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:48.634
Do something!

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.595
-We're out of time!
-Hang on!

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.642
That's the accelerator!

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:57.727
Then this one!

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:03.983
It's too late!

00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:41.771
Excuse me. What about these?

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.525
Can you use these?

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:53.157
Support braces.
Maybe I can use them in a game.

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.409
-Thanks, Taro.
-Great.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.370
We found one!

00:08:57.453 --> 00:09:00.373
Ryuji, look what we got!

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.419
-Would you like to try it?
-Yeah.

00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:07.588
All right.

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:09.465
-One, two…
-One, two…

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:10.925
Okay.

00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:22.186
Hang in there, Arisu!

00:09:36.617 --> 00:09:37.618
Arisu.

00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:41.998
Please. You're the only one
who can stitch him up.

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.835
There's no way I can do that.

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:47.545
You can.

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:51.799
You stopped my leg from bleeding.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.261
See? It's all better now.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:59.223
Bleeding's one thing.
Stitches are totally different!

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.853
This was all I could find.

00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:05.146
A sewing kit.

00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:06.939
Stitch him up with that?

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.524
It's all I could find.

00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:10.192
You can do it.

00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:11.902
Please.

00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:15.239
Alcohol and water for disinfection.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.909
Come on, hurry!

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:20.119
He's gonna die!

00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:23.873
Arisu? Arisu!

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:34.717
Hey! That's for disinfection!

00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:36.969
It stops the shaking.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.101
You should sleep.

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:10.187
What about you?

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:12.690
You were crying.

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:30.082
Like you…

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:34.712
I keep having the same dream.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.218
Something you can't forget?

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:44.930
I…

00:12:47.224 --> 00:12:49.059
I was obsessed with death.

00:12:51.061 --> 00:12:52.062
That's why…

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:57.777
I crossed a line…

00:12:59.987 --> 00:13:01.363
I shouldn't have.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.157
That's all for today.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:09.830
Professor Matsuyama.

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:13.000
I read your paper.

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:14.418
It was fascinating.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.964
You're interested in mental illness?

00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:23.803
No, I mean the part that says
stimulating a part of the temporal lobe

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.180
can reproduce near-death experiences.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:38.859
You're the only one at this university
who has shown interest in that.

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:44.698
I read that near-death experiences
might give us a glimpse of the afterlife.

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:48.369
Yano, do you believe in an afterlife?

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:51.497
I want to experience it myself.

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.749
-Experience it?
-Yes.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.336
I hope you'll prove
that the world of death is real.

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:01.090
There's only one way to do that.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:02.758
What is it?

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.096
To have a near-death experience.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.023
With this drug?

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:23.863
But I can't vouch for its effects.

00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:39.712
Professor,

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:42.798
I still want to try it.

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.302
But…

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:52.683
Don't you want to discover
a world unknown to others?

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:56.145
But it's dangerous.

00:14:57.813 --> 00:15:00.858
It's fine. I want to see it
more than anything.

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:03.569
Please, Professor.

00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:05.070
I'm begging you.

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:45.713
Yano?

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:48.882
Hey.

00:16:49.925 --> 00:16:50.968
Wake up.

00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:51.927
Yano!

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.988
A student was found dead

00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:14.033
after a failed experiment
at Shushikan University.

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:17.202
Investigators are considering
both suicide and foul play.

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:21.373
The assistant professor in charge
was suspected of assisted suicide,

00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:23.625
but there was not enough evidence
to press charges.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:27.129
There was an accident in which
a car collided with a guardrail.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:30.549
The driver, a man in his thirties,
was in cardiac arrest…

00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:33.135
He regained consciousness
but is in critical…

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:35.262
Was it an accident or a suicide?

00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:39.141
I hear Prof. Matsuyama's car accident
was really a suicide attempt

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:41.268
after that student's death.

00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:43.187
They say he went into cardiac arrest.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.523
Maybe he got
his wish to see the afterlife.

00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:47.608
Nice one.

00:17:58.202 --> 00:17:59.870
AFTERLIFE, SHARED CONSCIOUSNESS

00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:01.580
NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES

00:18:01.663 --> 00:18:02.915
NOT BOUND BY TIME

00:18:02.998 --> 00:18:05.709
WHEN THE SUBJECT'S HEART STOPS…

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:09.171
…ONCE RESUSCITATED,
THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS RETURNS…

00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:43.205
Once you cross that line,

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.083
there's no return.

00:18:57.427 --> 00:18:58.554
You can return.

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:08.147
There's something I realized
after coming back here.

00:19:12.776 --> 00:19:13.902
Any wound…

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:18.657
can give us a reason to live.

00:19:25.622 --> 00:19:26.623
I'm not so sure.

00:19:35.215 --> 00:19:37.342
Let's make it back to our world.

00:19:58.322 --> 00:19:59.364
Arisu?

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:02.492
Arisu!

00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:06.288
What a relief.

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:08.707
Sorry.

00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:14.588
When does the game start?

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:18.926
At sundown today.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.806
We're gonna be late.

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:28.477
No, you need to rest.

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:42.157
You guys go ahead.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.035
No way we can do that.

00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:48.622
He's right. We can't leave you behind.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:53.585
Arisu, you saved me
during the fortune and zombie games.

00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:55.837
Me too.

00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:59.967
I guess you saved me too.

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:05.514
And me.

00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:58.317
Attention all players.

00:21:59.526 --> 00:22:02.029
The semifinal games are about to begin.

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:08.910
Survivors will be eligible
to participate in the final game.

00:22:10.537 --> 00:22:12.956
The game is Tokyo Bingo Tower.

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:45.530
The rules are as follows.
Play bingo on Tokyo Tower.

00:22:48.075 --> 00:22:52.621
Climb Tokyo Tower and press the buttons

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:56.541
to complete a vertical,
horizontal, or diagonal line

00:22:56.625 --> 00:23:00.045
to get bingo and win the game.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.092
Work together as a team to get bingo.

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.594
Yuna, calm down.

00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:10.722
Climb slowly. Nice and slow.

00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:12.599
Come on.

00:23:19.022 --> 00:23:20.857
At the very top,

00:23:20.941 --> 00:23:24.111
there's a button
for the FREE space in the middle.

00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:26.196
Good luck.

00:23:55.142 --> 00:23:56.810
The game is Kick the Can.

00:23:57.727 --> 00:23:59.229
First can. Begin.

00:24:16.037 --> 00:24:18.999
The rules are,
return the can to its starting spot

00:24:19.082 --> 00:24:23.295
and step on it
to win the game before time runs out.

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:30.594
There will be ten cans.

00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:34.014
So only ten people survive this one?

00:24:44.941 --> 00:24:45.942
What the hell?

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:49.905
Some floors have escalators
that we can't use.

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:50.864
That way!

00:24:56.453 --> 00:24:58.205
What?! It's a dead-end!

00:24:58.288 --> 00:24:59.206
Shit!

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:01.583
This won't open either!

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.168
Shit!

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:04.628
This sucks!

00:25:04.711 --> 00:25:06.671
-Where is it?
-It's not here.

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:09.132
-What about over there?
-No, let's go that way!

00:25:22.312 --> 00:25:23.355
All right!

00:25:23.438 --> 00:25:25.649
The can is a time bomb.

00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:28.068
Safety mechanism deactivated.

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:30.278
Nothing's gonna stop me!

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:35.784
The time bomb countdown begins
the moment someone picks it up.

00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:36.952
Yeah, right!

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:38.620
DO NOT USE

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.458
If you let go,

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:45.544
the timer resets

00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:47.671
and a new countdown begins.

00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:50.215
Five goddamn seconds less.

00:25:51.174 --> 00:25:55.554
The time limit decreases by five seconds
when the holder changes.

00:25:57.764 --> 00:25:59.474
Twenty seconds left.

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:01.059
Hey!

00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:06.106
-No way!
-We'll waste a can if no one takes it!

00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:07.482
-I can't!
-Go already!

00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:10.694
-Reset. 50 seconds left.
-The can! This way!

00:26:10.777 --> 00:26:11.695
Go!

00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:13.530
-Wait!
-Found it!

00:26:13.613 --> 00:26:14.781
Don't chase me!

00:26:20.954 --> 00:26:23.290
Reset. Fifteen seconds left.

00:26:28.795 --> 00:26:29.921
Ten seconds left.

00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:39.681
Come on!

00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:50.066
First can, game over.

00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:54.988
The can exploded, so no one won this time.

00:26:56.239 --> 00:26:57.866
Nine cans left.

00:27:01.369 --> 00:27:02.787
Second can. Begin.

00:27:29.189 --> 00:27:30.398
Look out!

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.451
There's no chance of winning on your own.

00:27:42.243 --> 00:27:44.412
-Teammates relay cans.
-Natsu!

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:46.081
-Rei!
-Then we score goals.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.085
-This is impossible.
-Wait!

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:53.129
-Help! Take it!
-Not so fast!

00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:55.924
Reset. Fifty seconds left.

00:27:58.885 --> 00:28:01.763
-Reset. Forty-five seconds left.
-Go, Big Sis!

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:03.765
-Hurry!
-Got it!

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.520
-Nine cans are left, and eight of us.
-Hey, wait!

00:28:08.603 --> 00:28:09.562
Found you!

00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:12.315
-Hey!
-Hey!

00:28:14.442 --> 00:28:15.402
Gimme that!

00:28:15.902 --> 00:28:16.903
Give it to me!

00:28:16.986 --> 00:28:17.862
Shion!

00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:19.114
Let go!

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:20.490
-Arisu!
-Down here!

00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:35.505
Second can, game over.

00:28:36.172 --> 00:28:41.302
Cans will explode
when subjected to violent impacts.

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:42.387
Shit!

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:45.223
Eight cans left.

00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:53.690
-Arisu!
-Take it down!

00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:55.775
Reset.

00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:57.318
Fifty seconds left.

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.321
Damn you!

00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:02.991
Arisu!

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:06.745
Wait, damn you!

00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:08.705
Kazuya!

00:29:10.206 --> 00:29:14.085
Either they die, or we die.
One or the other!

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.546
-No time to hesitate!
-Get him!

00:29:16.629 --> 00:29:17.505
Go!

00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:19.466
Okay! Come on, let's go!

00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:21.718
Hurry!

00:29:22.802 --> 00:29:23.887
Move, damn you!

00:29:27.474 --> 00:29:28.349
Hand it over!

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:30.685
Stop!

00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:35.732
Sachiko!

00:29:35.815 --> 00:29:36.816
Me?

00:29:39.152 --> 00:29:40.069
Get her!

00:29:40.153 --> 00:29:42.530
Reset. Twenty seconds left.

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:45.700
Pass it!

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.453
Let me go!

00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:50.497
Let go!

00:29:51.372 --> 00:29:52.916
Ten seconds left.

00:29:56.377 --> 00:29:57.962
Go, Sachiko!

00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:08.056
Third can, game cleared.

00:30:13.102 --> 00:30:14.354
Thank you.

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:17.565
Ladies first.

00:30:23.196 --> 00:30:27.325
Please wait in the elevator
if you have won.

00:30:27.408 --> 00:30:29.494
All right, that's the first person.

00:30:43.299 --> 00:30:44.968
Seven cans left.

00:31:00.108 --> 00:31:00.984
Himari!

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:04.654
Help me, Usagi!

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.906
Ryuji, I'll go help her.

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:47.196
Himari!

00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:57.415
It's okay.

00:31:57.999 --> 00:31:59.667
Just hold on to me.

00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:17.685
-It's okay!
-Look out!

00:32:21.147 --> 00:32:22.148
Himari!

00:32:39.707 --> 00:32:40.750
You can do it.

00:33:16.285 --> 00:33:18.037
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

00:33:19.872 --> 00:33:20.873
I'm fine.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.252
Let's take it to the end.

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:25.503
Okay.

00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:30.842
Hey!

00:33:35.888 --> 00:33:36.973
Hey!

00:33:37.557 --> 00:33:40.018
Let go, you asshole!

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:42.937
-Shit!
-Go on ahead.

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:44.605
Let's win this together.

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:48.151
-Reset. Fifty seconds left.
-Shit! Let go!

00:33:48.234 --> 00:33:49.527
No way, asshole!

00:33:57.827 --> 00:34:00.246
Sorry!

00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:02.165
-Hey, stop!
-Let go!

00:34:02.248 --> 00:34:05.293
-Please!
-Goddamn son of a bitch!

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:07.879
Stop it!

00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:14.385
Tetsu!

00:34:15.094 --> 00:34:16.429
-Go!
-What?

00:34:16.512 --> 00:34:18.181
Just go! Hurry!

00:34:18.264 --> 00:34:21.350
Get back here, damn you!

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:29.400
Yes!

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:33.946
-It's a fake, goddammit!
-Shit!

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:42.997
There you are.

00:34:44.457 --> 00:34:45.458
Wait!

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:48.044
Hand it over!

00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:51.339
Give it to me, dammit!

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.311
Shion!

00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:07.688
No!

00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:26.624
Big Sister…

00:35:28.876 --> 00:35:29.877
What happened?

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:36.968
Shit.

00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:48.896
What is this?

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.150
What the hell?!

00:35:53.943 --> 00:35:54.944
Calm down, Tetsu.

00:35:55.444 --> 00:35:57.989
I am calm. Completely calm. I'm fine.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.492
-Stay strong, Tetsu.
-Shut it!

00:36:05.288 --> 00:36:06.205
Next can.

00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:20.029
Okay.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:36.963
Yuna, look at me.

00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:38.589
Don't look down.

00:37:40.174 --> 00:37:41.968
I can't do this anymore.

00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:45.263
Let's keep going.

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:47.765
Otherwise, the balls will get us.

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:50.893
We gotta press the buttons to win.

00:37:51.894 --> 00:37:54.272
Just grab the rope.

00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:56.607
It'll be okay.

00:37:56.691 --> 00:37:57.525
See?

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.613
Yes, that's it. Don't look down.

00:38:35.521 --> 00:38:37.356
-You all right?
-Thanks.

00:38:44.447 --> 00:38:47.033
Never mind me. Go on ahead.

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.619
Okay. I'm gonna go win the game.

00:38:56.709 --> 00:38:58.586
Fifth can. Begin.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.465
Arisu!

00:39:02.965 --> 00:39:04.091
Hand it over!

00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:06.260
Get back here!

00:39:16.103 --> 00:39:17.313
Rei, you take it!

00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:24.987
-Let me go!
-Go for it, Rei!

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.827
Fifth can, game cleared.

00:39:33.579 --> 00:39:34.580
Thank you.

00:39:39.168 --> 00:39:41.212
Sixth can. Begin.

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:47.385

00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:50.888
Natsu!

00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:54.266
Tetsu!

00:40:07.863 --> 00:40:08.989
Nobu, here!

00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:11.784
Ten seconds left.

00:40:14.203 --> 00:40:16.288
Go!

00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:17.206
Okay!

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:22.962
Seventh can, game cleared.

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:25.673
Thanks.

00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:28.092
And I'm sorry.

00:40:32.012 --> 00:40:33.597
Three cans left.

00:40:33.681 --> 00:40:35.182
Three of us left.

00:40:36.183 --> 00:40:37.059
Yeah.

00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:42.481
I'm gonna win this one for Big Sis.

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:48.446
Thirty seconds left.

00:41:01.333 --> 00:41:03.002
Twenty seconds left.

00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:16.891
Reset. Thirty-five seconds left.

00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:25.524
Reset. Thirty seconds left.

00:41:29.236 --> 00:41:30.070
Die!

00:41:37.578 --> 00:41:38.954
You can't have it!

00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:42.917
Reset. Twenty-five seconds left.

00:41:44.793 --> 00:41:47.713

Reset.

00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:09.527
Ten seconds left.

00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:12.279
It's mine!

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:13.614
Give it!

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:15.366
-Let go!
-Let go of my can!

00:42:15.449 --> 00:42:17.535
-My can! Give it to me!
-Get off me!

00:42:18.452 --> 00:42:19.453
It's my can!

00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:25.793
Goddammit!

00:42:29.838 --> 00:42:32.216
Eighth can, game over.

00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:35.094
Don't tell me… Natsu…

00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:38.556
No way, right?

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:42.142
I can't take it anymore.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.274
Two people left.

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:40.659
-One more to win.
-One more!

00:43:48.876 --> 00:43:52.046
No! I don't want to die!

00:43:54.048 --> 00:43:55.424
Look out!

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:57.509
Taro!

00:44:27.623 --> 00:44:28.457
Hey!

00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:31.293
-Twenty seconds left.
-You go first!

00:44:31.877 --> 00:44:33.545
You can't run anymore!

00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:36.382
Go already!

00:44:42.888 --> 00:44:44.348
Wait!

00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:45.432
Arisu!

00:44:52.606 --> 00:44:53.816
Get off me, dammit!

00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:58.654
-Ten seconds left.
-Go!

00:44:58.737 --> 00:45:00.989
There's no time! Go!

00:45:10.416 --> 00:45:11.333
Arisu!

00:45:14.586 --> 00:45:16.296
Ninth can, game cleared.

00:45:21.343 --> 00:45:22.928
Now we're even.

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:27.391
Don't worry.

00:45:28.684 --> 00:45:30.227
There's one more can left.

00:45:31.645 --> 00:45:32.896
I'll win this one.

00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:35.524
Kazuya.

00:47:12.788 --> 00:47:14.706
Safety mechanism deactivated.

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:22.089
Goddamn you!

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.932
-Kazuya!
-Go!

00:47:33.392 --> 00:47:35.060
Go!

00:47:39.773 --> 00:47:40.607
Kazuya!

00:47:41.483 --> 00:47:43.277
-Shit!
-Let go!

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:49.825
Let go!

00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:04.965
-Stop it.
-Shit!

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.717
-Enough already!
-Open up!

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.385
-Stop it!
-Open up!

00:48:08.468 --> 00:48:09.303
Enough!

00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:18.270
The can!

00:48:18.353 --> 00:48:19.354
It's mine!

00:48:21.648 --> 00:48:22.566
Hey!

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.234
Let me go!

00:48:36.246 --> 00:48:37.623
Asswipes!

00:48:49.843 --> 00:48:51.595
Bring it!

00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:00.020
Goddamn you!

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:26.004
Ten seconds left.

00:49:38.433 --> 00:49:40.686
Kazuya!

00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:22.352
Bingo.

00:50:26.773 --> 00:50:29.901
CONGRATULATIONS

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:05.187
Had your fill of this world?

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.982
I brought Usagi this far, as promised.

00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:11.151
The next game's the last.

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.488
You'll make sure
Arisu remains here for good.

00:51:16.364 --> 00:51:18.158
Why is he so important?

00:51:19.618 --> 00:51:22.245
He helped us win the previous games,

00:51:23.163 --> 00:51:25.999
and I became a citizen thanks to him.

00:51:27.626 --> 00:51:29.669
He'll be the ideal citizen.

00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:35.133
Who… are you?

00:51:40.138 --> 00:51:41.473
Are you the Joker?

00:51:46.895 --> 00:51:49.523
It all came back to me
after I returned here.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:54.152
If there's an entity ruling
the world of death, tell me what it is.

00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:56.863
You ask too much.

00:51:57.739 --> 00:51:59.950
Focus on the job you were given.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.244
You're not finished yet.

00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:11.378
Kill her in the next game.

00:52:12.838 --> 00:52:14.881
That's your final job.

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:23.014
I'm betting he'll become a citizen
and remain in this world if she dies.

00:52:25.725 --> 00:52:27.519
That's why you're doing this?

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.028
Your wish will be granted if you kill her.

00:52:45.704 --> 00:52:48.290
You'll learn who rules this world

00:52:49.249 --> 00:52:54.629
and discover the true world of death
that lies beyond here.

00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:57.799
Then you can do as you please.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.971
You can become a citizen
or return to your own world.

00:53:06.725 --> 00:53:09.311
There's no better deal if you ask me.

00:53:22.657 --> 00:53:26.161
You shouldn't use this world
for your own pleasure.

00:53:27.245 --> 00:53:30.749
I'm glad to be a citizen,
but no one brings their A game.

00:53:31.791 --> 00:53:35.337
I'll only enjoy this world
if there are skilled players.

00:53:36.504 --> 00:53:37.505
That's true.

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:41.676
Nobody brings their A game
in my stage either.

00:53:42.594 --> 00:53:44.888
In any case, we need able citizens.

00:53:46.431 --> 00:53:50.060
So you say,
but aren't you just having fun?

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.314
Yeah, maybe I am.

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:17.170
So this is the final game?

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.718
A game arena in Shibuya?

00:54:25.345 --> 00:54:27.430
I hope we get out of here alive.

00:54:28.306 --> 00:54:30.934
Remember me now and then if I die.

00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:34.437
No promises.

00:54:35.855 --> 00:54:36.690
Seriously?

00:54:37.649 --> 00:54:39.484
Then don't forget me either.

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:43.029
I'll never forget you, Tetsu.

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:49.411
No hard feelings
if we betray each other, all right?

00:54:50.704 --> 00:54:51.788
That's a given.

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.043
All right.

00:55:01.172 --> 00:55:02.090
Let's go.

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:25.655
I've got a bad feeling about this.

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:27.991
Who goes first?

00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:41.296
Ladies first.

00:55:41.379 --> 00:55:42.756
No thanks.

00:56:43.316 --> 00:56:44.150
Huh?

00:59:15.593 --> 00:59:18.346
