00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.641
If you're alive, make some noise!

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:01.728
You're alive!

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.279
Uh…

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.909
What was our, uh, score today?

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:00.078
Five hundred points.

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:01.663
- Five hundred? That's high.
- Whoa.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.623
Maki only earned three.

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:07.001
- I'm worth at least five.
- That's hilarious.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.002
Brutal.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:11.464
Hell of a show though, huh? We crushed it.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.883
- The crowd was really into it.
- Yeah.

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:17.178
Okay, listen up.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.848
- Listening.
- We need today's driver, yeah?

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.725
- We'll point at them on three.
- Yeah?

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.852
- You point.
- Point?

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.436
- Yeah, on three. Shit.
- Okay.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.272
- Whoever did the worst today.
- Yeah.

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:28.815
- Right?
- Okay.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.151
- On three.
- I know who I'm picking.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:32.652
- You ready?
- Sure.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.446
- Let's…
- Okay!

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.240
One, two--

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.505
We're the citizens of this country.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:56.467
Citizens?

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.136
Sure. Citizens.

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.138
What do you mean?

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.723
We're all living here, right?

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.391
Who can say?

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:07.687
In this place, I'm the leader.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.773
We created this game.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:14.277
That man, Shitara? All his idea.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.072
Well, to be fair,
this is a brand-new experience for us.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.617
We haven't played a game of it yet
as a team.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.914
What does that mean?
We're competing against citizens now?

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.540
Us against the five of you?

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:28.583
Yeah.

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.211
When you play a face card game,

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.214
you're competing against citizens
fighting for their lives.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.591
Anyone who loses is killed.

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.092
So…

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.139
these are games of life or death
for us citizens as well.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.019
It's time to begin.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.773
The game we'll be playing is…

00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:56.069
Difficulty, King of Clubs.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:57.779
Game…

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.114
Osmosis.

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:04.118
Osmosis…

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:23.323
Now, the rules are simple.

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:27.577
The game lasts two hours.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.829
Both teams try to collect points.

00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:33.124
The team with the highest total
at the end of the game wins.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:37.462
Each team begins with 10,000 points.

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:41.382
Players divide these points
amongst themselves before the game begins.

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.428
The minimum amount is 100 points.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.056
You're free to divide them up
any way you want.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.266
Talk it over as a team and decide.

00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:55.396
Points distribution is a key element
of strategy in this game.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:01.944
How does one earn points?

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.823
There are three ways
you can do so in this game.

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:10.787
Battle, items, and base.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.163
Hold on!

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:13.915
Yeah, you got a question?

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:16.501
How do we remember all this?

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.294
Right.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.339
I guess it's easier once you do it, huh?

00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:24.592
A demonstration.
You've got random points for now.

00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:28.763
Your bracelet shows
your individual points.

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.058
Let's try a battle.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.227
ARISU

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.147
A battle's outcome depends entirely
on your current points.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:42.485
To initiate one,
all you need to do is touch your opponent.

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:43.694
Hey!

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:50.535
NIRAGI 2,000
KYUMA 3,500

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:52.829
Whoever has more points wins.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.832
The winner steals 500 points
from the loser.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.716
The scores have been updated.

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:13.891
The King of Clubs team
is now leading by 1,000 points.

00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:23.359
ARISU

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.362
So you don't know
your opponent's score until you battle.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.906
No. You know what that means, right?

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.200
It means these battles are a huge gamble,

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.828
where you're unable
to see your opponent's strength.

00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:37.331
Something else you can try
is to pair up with a teammate.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.417
For example…

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.045
You two. Try holding hands.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:51.053
Oh wow, what's this?
A bit nervous, are ya?

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:05.401
Would you look at that? Cute couple.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:10.990
All right.
If teammates hold hands like this,

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:13.618
they're able to battle
using their combined points,

00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:16.871
allowing them to beat an opponent
they couldn't defeat on their own.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.711
The winners get the 500
divided between them.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:28.925
Cuties.

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.302
On to items!

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.763
ITEM

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:38.935
There are items for you to find, six
of them, hidden amongst the containers.

00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:42.563
Ugh, this area's huge!

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.816
There are only six items
in all these shipping containers?

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.153
Touching an item
will earn your team some points.

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.739
And finally, we come to these poles.

00:08:51.822 --> 00:08:53.991
Bases are a big part of the game.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.952
They can turn the tide.

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:04.252
This pole is your base.
Ours is on the other side.

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:05.378
BASE

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:09.590
If you manage to touch
your opponents' base,

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.301
10,000 points are yours.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:16.305
10,000 points?
Don't both teams start with that?

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:20.226
Exactly why you need to keep someone back
to protect your base.

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:25.189
But while a player is touching
their own base, they have infinite points.

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.191
Infinite?

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.070
How do you battle someone
with infinite points?

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:35.783
Come here.

00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:54.427
ARISU 2,250
KYUMA INFINITE

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.180
I was touching my base,
so you lose 10,000 points.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.557
ARISU -7,750
KYUMA 3,500

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.267
And I gain 10,000.

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:05.396
ARISU -7,750
KYUMA 13,500

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.106
Hang on…

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.859
So what would happen to him?

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:12.028
His score would have dropped below zero.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:13.863
Pyeeow.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.406
Shot down.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.870
If you try to touch the other team's base

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:25.875
{\an8}and their goalie manages to touch you,
you lose 10,000 points.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:31.505
{\an8}You die, and the opposing team
gains 10,000 points?

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.050
That's way too risky.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.802
If you pull it off,
you can change everything.

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:41.766
Something else.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.519
After completing a battle
or touching the other team's base,

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.271
players are temporarily out of commission.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.272
INACTIVE

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.192
During this time, their points are frozen.
They're immune.

00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:54.070
If you touch an opponent
while they're out of commission…

00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.532
…your wristband will give you
an electric shock.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.702
Enough to knock you out, so be careful.

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:04.121
Once you touch your own base,

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:07.166
your status is reset
and you can resume play.

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:15.341
So, you know the rules. Split up
your points now, then the game begins.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.348
Hold on.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.104
I'm Arisu.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:30.981
Kyuma…

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:35.820
tell me something, before we fight.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.658
If we beat all the games here,

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:44.745
will we go back to our world?

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:51.502
Your world? What is your world?

00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:55.673
The way that you're speaking about it,

00:11:57.299 --> 00:12:00.636
you're making it sound
like your world must be the real one.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.432
What are you talking about?

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:06.976
Tell me something.

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:10.563
How many real conversations did you have?

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:12.857
How many heart-to-hearts did you have?

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:16.402
Our flaws, our pride.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.156
Those are exposed here, in this world.

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:24.076
When we look death in the eye,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.705
we face true human nature and reality.

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:36.046
This world is more real
than any you left behind.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.883
These games are conversations.

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:41.802
Let's really talk, you and I.

00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:44.430
Let us expose our true hearts.

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:45.431
Arisu.

00:12:47.224 --> 00:12:49.018
You want the truth, yeah?

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:52.271
Face me with everything you have.

00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:05.701
All right, then.

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.497
I'll play your game.

00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:23.010
Is it just me,
or was Kyuma being nice to us?

00:13:23.093 --> 00:13:24.553
Just like a normal guy.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.681
Buck naked and crazy. Yeah, real normal.

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:30.184
This game'll be a bloodbath,
just like all the others.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.145
Okay.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.606
Let's distribute the points.

00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:38.859
How many do we each get? Got any ideas?

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.363
Split 'em five ways, no?

00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:45.115
We're not going to win
splitting them evenly between us.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.119
Usagi's right.

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:53.332
It's like Kyuma said.
It's an important decision for the game.

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:55.125
The initial point split is crucial.

00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:57.378
You got a plan or what?

00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:07.721
Game start.

00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:27.741
Whooooo!

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:42.464
Here's the plan.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.925
The faster runners get fewer points.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.720
Slower runners get more.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:53.350
The guard at the base
gets the least number of points possible.

00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:58.772
We go out in pairs,
one fast runner with one slower runner.

00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:01.901
Why'd you pair up with me, anyway?

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:03.986
You like me that much, huh?

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:06.864
Please. Because I won't care
if you die in front of me.

00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:11.118
Pairing up for battles
has many advantages,

00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:14.830
but one of the biggest
is they can only see your combined points.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.499
They won't know
how many points you each have.

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:33.891
We've got 5,000 between us.

00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:35.559
He won't have more than that.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.937
They'd be crazy
to give one person half their points.

00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:41.565
- Let's get him.
- Yeah, let's get it done.

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:50.824
Uh-oh…

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.412
Huh?

00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:59.375
Guess he didn't have that many after all.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.013
Nothing here either.

00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:17.643
No. Come on.

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:28.570
Hey. Why'd you pair up Usagi with Niragi?

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:29.571
Strategy.

00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:32.324
What's going on with you two?

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.076
What do you mean?

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.245
Arisu…

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.457
If something's changed
between you and Usagi,

00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:41.959
shouldn't you tell us?

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.129
No, we're fine. It's fine, okay?

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:48.007
If you say so.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.637
Oh!

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:55.055
Is that an item?

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.160
KUINA
ITEM

00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:22.499
2,000 points!

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:24.251
Awesome!

00:17:25.794 --> 00:17:26.962
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.174
The player team
has secured an item.

00:17:30.257 --> 00:17:34.428
The player team is now leading
by 2,000 points.

00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:37.097
- We're winning!
- Yeah, that's pretty cool!

00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:41.310
Congratulations.

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.484
Look, we can't avoid each other forever.

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:49.777
You wanna battle or what?

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:53.864
ARISU

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:55.866
KUINA

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.590
Stay close, Arisu.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.718
It's two on one. We'll take it slow.

00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:16.553
Yeah.

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.642
I couldn't help but overhear.

00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:23.644
Sounds like there's an issue.

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:26.313
You're fighting
with one of your teammates.

00:18:33.153 --> 00:18:34.113
Arisu,

00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:37.866
you have a certain strength about you.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.161
The look of someone who has faced death.

00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:43.789
A man will do whatever it takes.

00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:46.333
That's why it's so strange.

00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:49.670
Your confidence…
Why on earth would it be shaken now?

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.760
The five of us were in a band before.

00:18:57.886 --> 00:18:59.763
Sometimes we would disagree,

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.683
and yet they'd be behind me
at the end of the day.

00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:06.812
And so…
I learned something about being a leader.

00:19:07.896 --> 00:19:10.649
You can't push people
into following you for no reason.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.777
You have to be ready to listen.

00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:15.571
Wait for them to come to you.

00:19:17.197 --> 00:19:20.909
Do that,
and they'll know they can depend on you.

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:28.250
Now,

00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:30.544
let's go.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.678
Don't hesitate! Not today!

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:43.223
We could die. We all could.
Me, my friends, and you.

00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:44.224
Arisu.

00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:47.728
Let's not end our lives with regret.

00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:48.896
If you're gonna die,

00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:52.232
wouldn't you rather give it
everything you've got?

00:20:06.246 --> 00:20:07.289
Arisu?

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:10.667
Kyuma.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.253
You said that

00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:18.300
to learn the truth, I have to face you
with everything I've got.

00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:20.302
Yeah.

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:24.681
I wanna learn more about who you are.

00:20:25.849 --> 00:20:27.434
So battle me alone, Kyuma.

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:34.816
Arisu?

00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:40.530
You've got it.

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:56.964
ARISU 4,600
KYUMA 2,000

00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:58.882
Gah!

00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:01.593
- The scores have been updated.
- I lost!

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:03.470
2,000 points?

00:21:03.553 --> 00:21:06.265
The player team is now leading
by 3,000 points.

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:07.849
ARISU INACTIVE

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:11.979
Wait a sec.

00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:14.314
Did you give everyone equal points?

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.734
Yeah, everyone got 2,000.

00:21:18.568 --> 00:21:20.696
I thought this was
a game of life or death.

00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:25.117
Here's what I think.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.744
My four teammates and I are equals.

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:29.913
We live or die together.

00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:37.587
So, Arisu,
did you learn something just now?

00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:07.159
Oh!

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:16.043
Ha!

00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:17.794
Ah! You got me!

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:18.795
Gah!

00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:22.382
- Yeah!
- The scores have been updated.

00:22:22.466 --> 00:22:27.220
The player team is now leading
by 4,000 points.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.639
Okay.

00:22:48.575 --> 00:22:51.161
The scores have been updated.

00:22:51.244 --> 00:22:53.413
- Yes!
- The player team is leading…

00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:54.956
I'm sorry.

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:01.213
All right, you guys!

00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:03.548
Things are going great so far.

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:06.676
This is a King game? Don't make me laugh.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.928
- Yeah!
- Hah!

00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:09.388
Yeah! Yeah!

00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:10.931
Pretty crazy to think…

00:23:11.014 --> 00:23:13.809
But I almost forgot
you're one of the bad guys, Niragi.

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:14.726
Huh.

00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:32.702
ARISU

00:23:32.786 --> 00:23:34.371
Well, what'd you learn?

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.874
- They split the points evenly.
- Evenly? Are you sure?

00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:40.419
2,000 each, yup.

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:43.839
We need to keep the pressure on.
And find more items if we can.

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:45.424
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:47.509
Tatta, you got this, buddy.

00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:49.845
Thanks.

00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:05.652
They're up by 5,000. I can't believe it.

00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:07.946
This is absolute bullshit!

00:24:08.738 --> 00:24:10.991
So, what do we do, o leader? Huh?

00:24:12.742 --> 00:24:14.077
They're certainly not bad.

00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:15.745
Huh? Oh, this is funny to you?

00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:20.208
Splitting the points up evenly
was your plan, Kyuma. You figure it out!

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.877
Hey, chill out, dude.

00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:25.380
This isn't some dictatorship.
He didn't decide for us.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.300
We did it together.

00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:31.803
Just like we've always done,
and just like we're going to keep doing.

00:24:32.512 --> 00:24:33.930
Absolutely!

00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:35.098
So what do we do?

00:24:35.849 --> 00:24:36.808
Yo, Maki!

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:39.436
Yeah, man, we all heard you.

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:40.979
So why don't you say something?

00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:44.816
I do have one idea.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.861
Me too. I've got an idea,

00:24:47.944 --> 00:24:49.863
if you don't mind something crazy.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.993
How funny would it be
if it was the same idea?

00:24:55.869 --> 00:24:58.205
Well, how about if we say it on three?

00:24:58.288 --> 00:24:59.331
Let's go.

00:25:01.082 --> 00:25:02.334
One, two…

00:25:06.546 --> 00:25:09.674
The player team has secured an item.

00:25:10.425 --> 00:25:15.013
The player team is now leading
by 6,000 points.

00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:16.973
Yes!

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:34.157
Hey.

00:26:03.478 --> 00:26:04.813
Why are you all here?

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:07.107
We're here so we can win, man.

00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:27.669
TATTA
INFINITE

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:31.715
You…

00:26:32.632 --> 00:26:33.633
I've got…

00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:35.510
I've got infinite points!

00:26:40.473 --> 00:26:41.975
You get tagged here…

00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:44.936
and you'll die!

00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:51.192
You're right.

00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:54.321
And since it's a game of life or death,

00:26:55.363 --> 00:26:57.574
why don't you tell us
who dies by your hand?

00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:02.245
What? But you'll be killed!

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:05.040
You'll die!

00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:07.792
Stay back!

00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:12.047
No! Don't!

00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:18.970
Ah! Ah!

00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:24.851
The scores have been updated.

00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:33.276
The King of Club team
is now leading by 4,000 points.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.611
They overtook us.

00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:37.405
What the hell?

00:27:39.032 --> 00:27:41.534
One player
on the King of Clubs team

00:27:41.618 --> 00:27:44.120
has had their score fall below zero.

00:27:53.797 --> 00:27:55.006
You picked me?

00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:08.103
You better use this to win.

00:28:09.813 --> 00:28:11.648
If I die in vain, I'm…

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:16.361
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you
in the afterlife, man.

00:28:16.444 --> 00:28:19.197
It is game over for the player.

00:28:25.328 --> 00:28:26.371
Shitara.

00:28:27.664 --> 00:28:28.957
You were my good friend.

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:31.668
I'll never forget what you did for us.

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:38.550
Later, man.

00:29:08.538 --> 00:29:09.789
Shitara.

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.202
Shitara.

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:10.642
They sacrificed a member of their team.

00:30:12.227 --> 00:30:14.896
Now three of them have 10,000 points each.

00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:18.024
Couldn't even guard one pole, huh?

00:30:18.107 --> 00:30:19.651
Fucking useless.

00:30:19.734 --> 00:30:22.195
Trash is always gonna be trash.

00:30:22.278 --> 00:30:23.863
You piece of shit!

00:30:23.947 --> 00:30:27.492
- Lay off of him. He did the best he could.
- The best he could?

00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:31.079
You get a chance to kill one of them,
obviously you kill Kyuma!

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.122
It's not that. We underestimated them.

00:30:33.623 --> 00:30:37.710
He was nice and we got sucked in,
so we forgot the most important thing.

00:30:38.294 --> 00:30:39.712
Kyuma is the King of Clubs.

00:30:39.796 --> 00:30:42.507
We forgot
that we're gambling with our lives.

00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:45.552
They're prepared to die.

00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:47.637
They've just shown us that.

00:30:48.721 --> 00:30:51.099
If we don't do something,
we're all finished.

00:30:58.022 --> 00:30:59.691
Only one hour left on the clock.

00:31:02.777 --> 00:31:05.113
We can turn this around
if we attack their base.

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:07.407
We can't get to their base
if they're defending it.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.785
- Yeah, Niragi's right.
- Then how do we win this thing?

00:31:11.494 --> 00:31:16.207
Split up again.
Forget battling. Items are the key.

00:31:16.791 --> 00:31:19.127
That's the only way
we're getting out of this alive.

00:31:19.627 --> 00:31:21.337
Come on. Hurry!

00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:48.114
The King of Clubs team
has secured an item.

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:53.661
The King of Clubs team is now leading
by 4,500 points.

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.371
Well, that ain't good.

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:14.223
Got ya.

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:19.646
The scores have been updated.

00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:25.401
The King of Clubs team is now leading
by 5,500 points.

00:32:29.697 --> 00:32:33.034
The King of Clubs team
has secured an item.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:38.414
The King of Clubs team
is now leading by 7,000 points.

00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:40.208
We're so fucked.

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:51.719
You alone?

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.143
Let's do this, you and me.

00:33:00.853 --> 00:33:02.313
You ought to know

00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:03.898
I'm making you work for this.

00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:12.240
All I need is one punch.

00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:14.742
You win this battle,

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.828
you'll be out cold for the rest.

00:33:35.138 --> 00:33:36.180
KUINA
INACTIVE

00:33:37.765 --> 00:33:39.225
Why'd you let me brag, dude?

00:33:39.308 --> 00:33:41.019
I didn't know you could fight.

00:33:43.312 --> 00:33:45.982
The scores have been updated.

00:33:46.065 --> 00:33:47.316
What are they doing?

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.446
The King of Clubs team
is now leading by 8,000 points.

00:34:11.632 --> 00:34:12.508
Sorry!

00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:14.343
Snooze, you lose.

00:34:19.682 --> 00:34:21.267
Yes! 3,000!

00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:23.770
The most valuable item.

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:27.982
What the hell?

00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:29.442
If you're both here, then…

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.778
Wait.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.781
There's no one guarding your base?

00:34:34.864 --> 00:34:35.740
Nope.

00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:39.077
We figured that you wouldn't have
the guts to invade ours.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.870
And we were right, weren't we?

00:34:43.122 --> 00:34:44.707
I can't believe this.

00:34:48.836 --> 00:34:51.297
You told me
you wanted answers, Arisu.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.719
The games are cruel. You know that.

00:34:57.804 --> 00:35:00.556
The value of a single life
is meaningless here.

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:02.266
Look at me.

00:35:03.309 --> 00:35:04.936
I just lost my best friend.

00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:08.940
His name was Shitara.

00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:11.275
He was my bandmate.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.654
We used to live in this dirty apartment.

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.699
The venues we played at were small.

00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:21.744
Certainly not the stuff of legends.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.163
But we had fun.

00:35:31.379 --> 00:35:33.131
By choosing to join this game,

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:37.426
you get to know
who the other players truly are.

00:35:38.928 --> 00:35:40.471
It bares their souls.

00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:43.724
Like music does.

00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:47.186
Maybe I…

00:35:48.771 --> 00:35:51.983
just wanted to expose
people's true humanity.

00:35:56.904 --> 00:35:59.782
Shitara was a good man,
and a good friend to me.

You must not forget.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.729
This is a game of life or death.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.232
The losers will die.

00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:38.571
Show me what you're made of, Arisu.

00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:53.836
Thirty minutes remain.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:58.049
The King of Clubs team
is currently leading by 12,000 points.

USAGI
INACTIVE

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:12.480
- Only 30 minutes left.
- And they're up by 12,000 points.

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:16.025
- We can't give up yet!
- We've got to find more items.

00:37:16.108 --> 00:37:17.485
It's not worth it.

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.612
There's only a few left.

00:37:20.112 --> 00:37:21.739
We have to do something!

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.700
I'm not sitting here waiting to die.

00:37:24.784 --> 00:37:26.953
Tatta still has
over 10,000 points.

00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:29.997
- We could pair up and battle--
- Fuck that!

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.251
Whose fault is it
we're in this position now?

00:37:33.793 --> 00:37:37.171
I'm not trusting this bitch to do anything
after he fucked us!

00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:40.758
Ah, it doesn't matter anyway.

00:37:41.384 --> 00:37:45.221
We can't make up 12,000 points
with little 500-point battles.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.685
If I were Kyuma,

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:53.562
what would I…

You want the truth, yeah?

00:38:07.743 --> 00:38:10.413
Face me with everything that you have.

00:38:10.496 --> 00:38:11.872
By choosing to play,

00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:16.460
you get to know
who the other players truly are.

00:38:18.045 --> 00:38:19.964
This is a game of life or death.

00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:22.842
Show me what you're made of, Arisu.

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:30.766
We have to attack their base.

00:38:32.768 --> 00:38:33.769
What?

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:38.232
Two of us get 20,000 points
from their base.

00:38:38.941 --> 00:38:41.527
- We can still win.
- We can't, man, no!

00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:44.280
I was there when they attacked us.

00:38:44.363 --> 00:38:45.573
It's impossible.

00:38:45.656 --> 00:38:48.826
- What makes you think we can pull it off?
- That's just it.

00:38:49.785 --> 00:38:51.620
We have to stop being afraid.

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:53.622
Believe in the plan.

00:38:54.707 --> 00:38:56.625
What are you talking about?

00:38:56.709 --> 00:38:58.836
The difference between us and them

00:38:59.378 --> 00:39:01.339
is whether we let our fear stop us.

00:39:02.131 --> 00:39:05.343
We break free, and we push the fear out!

00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:09.221
It's too risky. I can't do it.

00:39:10.598 --> 00:39:12.850
I won't throw our lives away like that.

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:17.063
But if we don't go,
then we're dead, and that's it.

00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:19.982
If we want to win, we have to take a risk.

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:22.568
You're my teammates.

00:39:23.402 --> 00:39:24.445
And my friends.

00:39:25.154 --> 00:39:27.156
I don't want any of us to die.

00:39:27.239 --> 00:39:29.867
But I would risk my life

00:39:30.993 --> 00:39:32.661
to be able to save yours.

00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:35.831
Well, I'm in.

00:39:41.337 --> 00:39:43.672
Not because of all this mushy shit.

00:39:44.298 --> 00:39:45.216
It's more.

00:39:46.008 --> 00:39:49.512
I'm not the kind of guy
to ever let fear get in my way.

00:39:55.184 --> 00:39:56.227
I wanna win.

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:01.107
I can't stand aside. I want to win this.

00:40:04.777 --> 00:40:06.153
Then it's settled.

00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:10.533
I can't let you take all the glory.

00:40:13.619 --> 00:40:14.578
I…

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:19.708
Tatta.

00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:22.336
You protect the base.

00:40:25.381 --> 00:40:26.382
Okay.

00:40:41.147 --> 00:40:44.608
If we guard this piece of metal,
then we're gonna win.

00:40:50.489 --> 00:40:51.490
Huh?

00:40:53.701 --> 00:40:55.369
Bet you can't catch me again!

00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:01.542
She's got 50 points left, max.

00:41:02.376 --> 00:41:04.503
One more hit and you're a goner!

00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:10.050
Goken, wait!

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:12.011
Don't let her provoke you like that.

00:41:13.095 --> 00:41:15.723
Come on, victory's ours either way!

00:41:22.563 --> 00:41:23.647
Aah!

00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:31.655
Yes, I'm alive!

00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:36.785
Let's party!

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.094
There's another one.

00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:26.585
You bored yet?

00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:31.423
You must be craving some fun.
You're looking for a rush, aren't you?

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.011
You know us so well!

00:42:36.095 --> 00:42:37.930
Isn't that right, Arisu?

00:42:47.273 --> 00:42:48.190

Huh?

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.091
Whooo!

00:44:08.729 --> 00:44:09.855
All set?

00:44:11.398 --> 00:44:12.358
Uh-huh.

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:42.054

Congrats on 10,000!
Too bad it's not enough!

00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:25.866
Well done, Arisu.

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:27.743
Your team had a good go.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.078
But your plan has failed you.

00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:33.457
You could get
the remaining items, of course,

00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:35.542
but it won't be enough.

00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:40.631
And we're not giving you
a chance to win now.

00:46:41.173 --> 00:46:44.593
We're guarding the base with
everything we've got till time runs out.

00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:47.638
Better accept it.

00:46:47.721 --> 00:46:49.973
Twenty minutes remain.

00:46:50.891 --> 00:46:55.229
The King of Clubs team
is currently leading by 3,000 points.

00:47:13.205 --> 00:47:15.290
I'm sorry.

00:47:17.793 --> 00:47:19.127
This is my fault.

00:47:22.798 --> 00:47:23.924
No.

00:47:25.425 --> 00:47:27.010
We gave it all we had.

00:47:29.555 --> 00:47:31.807
My plan just wasn't good enough.

00:47:32.558 --> 00:47:33.559
I'm sorry.

00:47:35.143 --> 00:47:37.688
So… So, what? That's it?

00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:44.945
Because of you,
we're all gonna fuckin' die, asshole.

00:47:56.999 --> 00:47:58.458
I'll look for items.

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:00.752
There's no point.

00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:03.755
Maybe not, but I have to do it.

00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:06.758
For me.

00:48:10.679 --> 00:48:11.889
I have to fight.

00:48:13.473 --> 00:48:14.933
See it through to the end.

00:48:26.528 --> 00:48:27.863
She's strong.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.700
I sure couldn't do that.

00:49:07.194 --> 00:49:09.821
"You're my teammates. You're my friends."

00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:16.203
What a crock of bullshit.

00:49:18.872 --> 00:49:20.040
Fuck!

00:49:30.884 --> 00:49:32.594
I was so stupid.

00:49:44.356 --> 00:49:45.941
Well, either way,

00:49:46.775 --> 00:49:48.443
I don't have much time left.

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:45.000
Isn't there anything we can do?

00:50:59.848 --> 00:51:00.849
I got it!

00:51:11.777 --> 00:51:14.863
The player team has secured an item.

00:51:17.365 --> 00:51:21.328
The King of Clubs team is now leading
by 500 points.

00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:23.955
Usagi found the final item!

00:51:26.708 --> 00:51:28.251
Just 500 to go.

00:51:29.044 --> 00:51:30.295
Think! Come on!

00:51:31.171 --> 00:51:32.672
We gotta do something!

00:51:35.842 --> 00:51:37.803
Kyuma's base… I have to go.

00:51:37.886 --> 00:51:39.137
Why?

00:51:39.221 --> 00:51:41.807
Five hundred.
That's nothing! We can do this!

00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:44.184
It's all over.

00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:47.604
If I'm going to die,
I'll do everything I can.

00:51:48.396 --> 00:51:49.439
Arisu.

00:51:52.484 --> 00:51:53.401
Huh.

00:51:54.111 --> 00:51:55.195
I have to say,

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.739
before I go to at least try…

00:52:00.659 --> 00:52:01.660
Tatta.

00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:05.163
I love your positive attitude.

00:52:06.039 --> 00:52:07.999
You've always cheered me up, Tatta.

00:52:12.504 --> 00:52:13.713
Thank you, friend.

00:52:26.726 --> 00:52:28.395
Ten minutes remain.

00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:32.274
The King of Clubs team
is currently leading by 500 points.

00:52:32.357 --> 00:52:33.775
There's still a chance.

00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:43.243
Niragi?

00:52:54.379 --> 00:52:56.089
Yeah, poor Niragi.

00:52:57.299 --> 00:53:01.553
- I found the last item. We just need 500--
- It's a waste of time.

00:53:02.804 --> 00:53:04.306
Well, I'm not giving up.

00:53:10.979 --> 00:53:12.731
We're all gonna die.

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:15.025
Me, you.

00:53:17.652 --> 00:53:20.197
Everyone's gonna die.

00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:27.370
You're better than all of us.

00:53:27.913 --> 00:53:30.874
That's what you think, isn't it,
that you're better than us, huh?

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.631
Am I really so unclean?

00:53:38.506 --> 00:53:39.466
Huh?

00:53:41.343 --> 00:53:43.553
Everyone looks at me like that now.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.899
I don't know if they hated me
because I was twisted,

00:53:56.608 --> 00:53:59.277
or if I became twisted
because they hated me.

00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:07.744
I guess Kyuma was right.

00:54:09.996 --> 00:54:12.916
Only by facing death
can you learn who you are.

00:54:15.001 --> 00:54:16.878
I get it now.

00:54:17.796 --> 00:54:19.130
I know who I am.

00:54:20.966 --> 00:54:23.927
I'm not the kind of person
with friends to rely on.

00:54:25.553 --> 00:54:28.431
I'm not the kind of person
with hopes and dreams.

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:31.893
I'm garbage.

00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:59.212
Me and you can finally finish
what we started!

00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:04.301
We can have one last screw,
right here, you and me,

00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:06.469
before we go out with a bang!

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:16.146
Usagi!

00:55:20.275 --> 00:55:21.109
Arisu!

00:55:21.693 --> 00:55:23.111
Shut the fuck up!

00:55:36.958 --> 00:55:39.502
Nine minutes remain.

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:43.631
The King of Clubs team
is currently leading by 500 points.

00:56:00.148 --> 00:56:02.525
Whooo!
