00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:23.523
Now, all the surviving players
will be given a choice.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.986
Please select whether you will accept
permanent residence in this land

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.280
or if you will not accept it.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:37.829
I…

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.168
don't want permanent residence.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.129
I also…

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.176
don't want it.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.599
PERMANENT RESIDENCE IN THIS LAND
ACCEPT / DO NOT ACCEPT

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:04.689
Of course, I'll take it.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.734
I will gladly take it as well.

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:15.158
This place offers endless possibilities.

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:35.095
I saw a red light.

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.140
But…

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:45.480
I thought it was fireworks,
so I didn't pay much attention to it.

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:51.152
I hid in a toilet stall with my friends.

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:56.241
I won't go into how we got there.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:02.831
But then everything went quiet.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.796
I don't remember anything after that.

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:17.178
The meteorite strike caused you
to go into cardiac arrest, correct?

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:19.639
That's right.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.394
Do you remember anything else?

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.486
There's nothing else.

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:41.161
Do you remember dreaming
while you were unconscious?

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.746
Did I dream?

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:46.875
About games.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.086
"Games"?

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:51.880
Did you?

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:56.342
A dream about games
where your life was on the line.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:08.479
No.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.150
You didn't?

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:15.528
But…

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:18.031
But what?

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:24.037
I feel like I dreamed about a journey.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:26.915
"A journey"?

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:33.796
Like I went to… a far-off land.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:48.770
Don't push yourself too hard.
Thank you for your time today.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:54.275
Please, Matsuyama. No leading questions.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:58.238
They might distort his memories.

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:01.282
Multiple survivors mentioned games.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.201
You may have planted the idea.

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:07.664
Fireworks came up again.
Multiple survivors mentioned that.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.666
It was probably just the meteor.

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:14.712
They all clearly experienced
the same thing.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:29.769
A former genius researching the afterlife…
He's lost it.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.939
He wasn't always like this.

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:36.109
-The Shibuya meteorite changed everyone.
-No, before that.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:40.196
That accident five years ago,
where the student died.

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:41.864
Oh, right.

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:43.866
That.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.291
There was nothing I could do.

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:55.003
I'm sorry.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:59.632
Forgive me.

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.875
The main hall is that way. Thank you.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.251
You're welcome.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.377
Thank you.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:43.384
I found your dream
about a journey very interesting.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.387
I'd love to hear more sometime.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:50.016
Please contact me directly
if you remember anything.

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.267
Okay, I will.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.396
Even if it seems absurd.

00:05:56.647 --> 00:05:57.648
"Absurd"?

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.194
Something no one else would believe.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:03.654
All right?

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.578
This way.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:19.545
Arisu.

00:06:20.963 --> 00:06:22.590
Hey. Sorry it took so long.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.095
-You must be tired.
-Sorry. Were you waiting long?

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.021
This is my wife.

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:42.235
-Mr. Matsuyama is an assistant professor.
-Hello.

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:45.530
My wife was also interviewed here today.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.074
You were in Shibuya too?

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.368
-That's right.
-I see.

00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:54.664
Would you tell me your story next time?

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:59.419
-Okay.
-I'm Ryuji Matsuyama.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.550
ASST. PROFESSOR, DEPT. OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
SHUSHIKAN UNIVERSITY

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:07.427
I'll be in touch.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.513
Sure.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:19.689
What did they ask you?

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.234
A bunch of stuff
about dreams and other things.

00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:26.779
Like we could ever remember.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:34.412
I wish my university was this big.

00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:38.332
Have you gotten used to
your counseling internship?

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:40.209
Yeah, pretty much.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:44.380
I bet I'll get hired full-time
after I graduate next year.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:48.593
Wow! I finally get a proper husband.

00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:49.927
Excuse me?

00:07:58.686 --> 00:07:59.812
Takuma Hagio.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:02.815
Sumiko Murakoshi.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.358
NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:05.568
Saaya Ishii.

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:07.862
ANSWERS FROM THE AFTERLIFE

00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:08.946
Shuto Aida.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:15.203
In my study,
the aforementioned ten subjects…

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:19.040
spoke of near-death experiences.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.251
They all had…

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.295
COHORT STUDY ON TOKYO METEORITE SURVIVORS

00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:26.297
…the exact same dream.

00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:29.258
A journey.

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:31.719
A deserted city.

00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:34.096
Games.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:36.724
Fireworks.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.315
MESSAGE

00:08:47.818 --> 00:08:51.239
I CAN SEE YOUR AFTERLIFE

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.616
FROM: NEAR-DEATH SUPPORT GROUP INFO

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.785
THERE'S A SHADY GROUP USING GROUP HYPNOSIS

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:57.245
TELL ME MORE. I'LL PAY 100 COINS

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.663
DEAL. ASK "HIM" FOR DETAILS

00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.122
MR. LORD

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.208
100 COINS
COINS SENT

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:08.214
MR. R, I FOUND A LEAD
THAT MAY INTEREST YOU

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.617
Whoa!

00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:39.787
I can't believe this is Shibuya.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.871
Seriously?

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:42.456
Whoa!

00:10:51.942 --> 00:10:53.861
Are you Mr. R?

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:59.158
Yes, I'm R.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:17.885
So… are you interested
in that seminar too?

00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:21.013
Yes.

00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:23.224
Could you invite me?

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.143
I heard there's a strict referral…

00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:29.814
Let me know when you're ready.

00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:32.942
-Tea, please.
-I'll have the same.

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:34.860
Okay.

00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:41.158
I wouldn't recommend it.

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:43.911
But

00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:47.164
if you do go, you'll understand

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.417
it's the real deal.

00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:54.755
What sort of experience did you have?

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.261
We do strange things.

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:05.474
"Strange things"? Like what?

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:10.771
Games.

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:15.985
"Games"?

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:18.738
Yes.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.490
They're exhilarating.

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.494
Like a sacred ritual.

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:42.344
You'll receive an email invitation
in a week.

00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:46.724
Go to the specified location.

00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:53.022
INBOX: (NO SUBJECT)

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:19.423
MR. R, THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:22.968
AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW,
WE HEREBY INVITE YOU TO THE "SEMINAR"

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:31.227
TUE, OCT 14, 2024, 23:00
KOTO SIDE OFFICE

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.647
WE LOOK FORWARD
TO YOUR ATTENDANCE, MR. R

00:15:31.555 --> 00:15:34.016
Thank you for coming.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:37.186
Please be seated over here.

00:15:58.874 --> 00:16:00.292
Please take a seat.

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:03.087
On that chair.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.341
You shouldn't move once you've sat down.

00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:35.995
Now then, let's begin the game.

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:38.539
What game?

00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:43.043
I came here for a near-death experience.

00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:47.381
You can only take part in the journey
if you win this game.

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:49.967
"Journey"?

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.431
Let's begin.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.726
The game is Old Maid.

00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:08.485
Please take your cards.

00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:21.665
Any pairs in your hand must be discarded.

00:17:22.332 --> 00:17:23.292
I have a pair!

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:28.630
Whoever has the Joker,
aka Old Maid, at the end wins.

00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:32.801
Okay, let's start with you.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:39.641
Note that whoever has the Joker
drawn from their hand is eliminated.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.144
What?

00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:51.737
You all heard me, right?

00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:55.365
You shouldn't move once you've sat down.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:18:00.120
If you do, you're eliminated.

00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:03.457
She's dead.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.337
No way. It's just an act, right?

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:33.005
Now it's getting interesting.

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:08.707
Crap.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.977
The odds are fifty-fifty.

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:30.687
One of us will die.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:45.304
Welcome to Borderland.

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:37.582
Dad?

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.458
Are you okay?

00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:21.918
Yeah.

00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:28.717
Had a bad dream?

00:24:31.178 --> 00:24:32.262
Are you all right?

00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:36.266
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:40.812
I just need some water.

00:24:50.113 --> 00:24:54.409
YUZUHA ARISU

00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:55.994
RESIDENTIAL LEASE

00:24:56.077 --> 00:24:59.873
We should consider buying someday
instead of renting, right?

00:25:00.415 --> 00:25:02.834
But first, we need to save some money.

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:04.961
Right.

00:25:05.921 --> 00:25:08.256
We splurged on our wedding rings.

00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:10.634
True.

00:25:13.637 --> 00:25:15.222
What an unusual color.

00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:17.807
That? I bought it by accident.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.810
I really like this color.

00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:22.229
You can have it.

00:25:22.312 --> 00:25:23.396
Really? Yay.

00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:26.816
Want some help moving?

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:30.237
No, I'll hire someone. I've got work too.

00:25:30.904 --> 00:25:32.781
I'll let you handle this.

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:33.782
Sure.

00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:36.284
Gotta go. Bye.

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:38.745
-Take care.
-See you.

00:25:42.582 --> 00:25:44.709
You're still brushing your teeth?

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:46.962
You'll be late. Bye.

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.129
Okay, see you.

00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:59.432
On the 19th of this month,
seven seminar attendees

00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:03.186
were found dead in a unit
of a mixed-use building

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.771
in Koto City, Tokyo.

00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:10.443
Police are investigating the incident
as a possible group suicide.

00:26:13.488 --> 00:26:17.534
The Tokyo Bay Area
is popular with foreign tourists,

00:26:17.617 --> 00:26:20.996
and we expect
that they'll also visit our store.

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:23.582
Then we should offer
a wide range of sizes.

00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:27.419
Like in Shibuya and Shinjuku,
where large sizes sell well.

00:26:27.502 --> 00:26:29.546
Right. I see your point.

00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:35.552
Here's the referral.

00:26:36.219 --> 00:26:39.306
This client was a victim
of the disaster at Shibuya Station.

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:45.353
They have chronic PTSD
and are still suffering from flashbacks.

00:26:46.229 --> 00:26:48.106
Trauma from the meteorite incident.

00:26:49.524 --> 00:26:51.860
-Show them to the room.
-Will do.

00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:57.699
Excuse me. Would you please
fill out this medical questionnaire?

00:26:58.325 --> 00:27:00.619
Please include your name and address.

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:05.540
Good morning.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:09.794
Please follow me.

00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:26.853
Can I get you something?

00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:29.981
We have coffee, tea… Whatever you like.

00:27:31.191 --> 00:27:32.484
Cold drinks too.

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:33.985
Arisu.

00:27:39.074 --> 00:27:43.161
We've… met before.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.665
What?

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:40.468
Our paths crossed

00:28:41.636 --> 00:28:43.722
in a far-off place.

00:28:46.182 --> 00:28:47.475
"A far-off place"?

00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:51.438
Some who had that near-death experience

00:28:52.814 --> 00:28:55.400
said they entered another world.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.446
Did they find hope there?

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.074
Or did they find despair?

00:29:06.536 --> 00:29:10.498
You must have had
a near-death experience too.

00:29:12.792 --> 00:29:15.003
You should have memories of that world.

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:21.050
Arisu…

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.680
It's all real. You just don't remember it.

00:29:59.172 --> 00:30:03.468
You probably think I'm crazy.

00:30:04.677 --> 00:30:07.639
But that world is real.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.309
Both you and I

00:30:12.435 --> 00:30:14.479
fought there and survived.

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.274
That's how we…

00:30:20.276 --> 00:30:21.986
returned to this world alive.

00:31:27.135 --> 00:31:31.264
I want to know what happened to us.

00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:34.267
So I did everything I could

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.478
to find a way to return to that world.

00:31:39.856 --> 00:31:40.982
And I found one.

00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:44.861
A way to enter that world…

00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:50.742
by using a certain drug.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.913
Sorry for the wait.

00:31:57.123 --> 00:31:58.499
Please have a seat.

00:32:49.842 --> 00:32:51.886
INCOMING CALL
YUZUHA USAGI

00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:55.181
Quitting time?

00:32:56.182 --> 00:32:57.183
Arisu…

00:32:57.934 --> 00:32:59.143
Wanna come over?

00:33:04.023 --> 00:33:05.191
What's wrong?

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:07.318
Where are you?

00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:10.530
Arisu…

00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:13.241
Yeah?

00:33:14.575 --> 00:33:15.660
I'll come get you.

00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:24.919
Usagi?

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:28.631
I'm sorry.

00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:31.134
Usagi?

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:45.940
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

00:34:14.844 --> 00:34:15.803
Usagi?

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:22.393
You there?

00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:29.400
The Public Safety Division
is also investigating this.

00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:33.905
At this point,
nothing suspicious has been found.

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.742
But she still hasn't even
contacted her workplace.

00:34:37.825 --> 00:34:41.621
There is something
we'd like you to look at.

00:34:41.704 --> 00:34:42.622
Show him.

00:34:45.041 --> 00:34:49.212
This is security footage from the hotel
where your wife was last seen.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:54.425
It's a resort hotel in the Tokyo Bay Area.

00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:00.932
Do you recognize this man?

00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:04.936
Yes.

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:07.355
I met him once before.

00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:10.608
He teaches at Shushikan University.

00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:13.152
Was he acquainted with your wife?

00:35:14.487 --> 00:35:17.865
We met him at his school
about two weeks ago.

00:35:22.495 --> 00:35:24.205
Did he abduct her?

00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:28.751
No, there's a more plausible explanation.

00:35:30.044 --> 00:35:31.879
I hate to say this,

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:37.343
but could she have been
secretly meeting with him?

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:40.638
It is a hotel, after all.

00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:42.932
And since you say they're acquainted,

00:35:43.432 --> 00:35:48.396
you might want to look into this
before filing a missing person report.

00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:01.033
I can't find my wife.

00:36:01.117 --> 00:36:03.744
She met with the professor
before I lost contact.

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:08.916
Professor Matsuyama hasn't been
answering his phone either.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.001
What?

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:20.970
He was obsessed
with strange subjects like the afterlife.

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:24.473
But it's not like him
to be absent without notice,

00:36:24.557 --> 00:36:26.767
so we wondered if something happened.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:38.905
He was also investigating occult meetings.

00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:40.573
It was scary.

00:36:40.656 --> 00:36:42.116
MASS SUICIDES AND CULTS

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.326
NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES

00:36:43.409 --> 00:36:45.578
Was your wife involved too?

00:36:56.631 --> 00:37:00.343
DID SHIGENORI USAGI KILL HIMSELF
AFTER STAGED-CLIMB ACCUSATIONS?

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.140
YUZUHA ARISU

00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:16.108
YUZUHA ARISU: INTERVIEW

00:37:16.192 --> 00:37:18.819
Do you dream often?

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.783
I think so.

00:37:25.993 --> 00:37:27.453
What sort of dreams?

00:37:28.037 --> 00:37:29.956
Could you be more specific?

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:39.548
I see the same scene over and over.

00:37:41.634 --> 00:37:42.760
Is it

00:37:44.053 --> 00:37:45.054
a nightmare?

00:37:49.141 --> 00:37:50.142
My father…

00:37:54.897 --> 00:37:56.315
He kills himself.

00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:00.319
I see.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.699
Any issues with him?

00:38:05.866 --> 00:38:07.034
None at all.

00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:11.330
My dad was a wonderful person.

00:38:13.874 --> 00:38:15.001
Could it be that

00:38:16.502 --> 00:38:18.796
you didn't get to say goodbye?

00:38:20.214 --> 00:38:22.049
Or that you have regrets?

00:38:29.056 --> 00:38:30.266
Don't push yourself.

00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:35.146
No, please listen.

00:38:36.856 --> 00:38:39.066
I can't tell anyone else.

00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:42.153
Even your husband?

00:38:45.197 --> 00:38:48.534
I don't… want to tell him.

00:38:52.288 --> 00:38:54.915
I met my husband, and we got married.

00:38:56.375 --> 00:38:58.753
I should be getting on with my life.

00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:03.632
But I'm still hung up on my dad.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.561
When I dream,

00:39:16.937 --> 00:39:20.858
I can feel my dad's presence.

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:24.028
It's like he's right there.

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:28.532
Even if I cry…

00:39:30.493 --> 00:39:31.660
Even if it hurts…

00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:36.957
Even if I see him kill himself…

00:39:38.084 --> 00:39:39.960
If my dad is there…

00:39:53.432 --> 00:39:55.226
Even if it's a nightmare…

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.355
I want to be there.

00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:23.921
The player who played a part
in winning every single game…

00:40:25.172 --> 00:40:27.800
I became a citizen thanks to you.

00:40:36.016 --> 00:40:37.435
I've wanted to meet you.

00:40:38.894 --> 00:40:42.815
Won't you return to that beautiful world?

00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:53.659
It will all come back to you.

00:40:54.743 --> 00:40:57.079
Then you, too, will return to that world.

00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:01.959
Let the games begin.

00:41:07.673 --> 00:41:10.759
Your beloved will also be participating…

00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:14.013
in the games.

00:41:18.726 --> 00:41:19.685
Let's have fun.

00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:02.561
-How is she?
-She's in a coma.

00:42:02.645 --> 00:42:05.689
But she could go
into cardiac arrest at any moment.

00:42:05.773 --> 00:42:09.401
There were no signs of resistance
or a violent struggle.

00:42:09.485 --> 00:42:11.028
According to the doctor,

00:42:11.111 --> 00:42:15.574
the man she was with may have forced her
to take some kind of drug.

00:42:15.658 --> 00:42:16.784
A drug?

00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:18.452
It might be a murder-suicide.

00:42:20.246 --> 00:42:21.830
Doctor, he's here.

00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:25.709
-You're the husband?
-Yes.

00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:30.714
I know this is a bad time,
but according to a blood test,

00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:34.093
your wife is pregnant.

00:42:34.927 --> 00:42:35.803
What?

00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:39.473
It's still early,
so we can't detect a heartbeat.

00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:42.393
Your wife might not have known.

00:42:43.644 --> 00:42:44.562
You can go in.

00:43:10.713 --> 00:43:12.298
Usagi.

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:17.678
This is the man
who was found collapsed with her.

00:43:18.887 --> 00:43:20.222
Please have a look.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.861
So you recognize him?

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:37.406
Can we ask you some questions?

00:43:47.207 --> 00:43:52.838
Have you heard about
the mass suicides in Tokyo?

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.341
What?

00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:59.386
Are you saying that guy abducted my wife

00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:02.514
and got her mixed up
in those mass suicides?

00:44:02.598 --> 00:44:06.602
It seems he'd been attending
those seminars.

00:44:06.685 --> 00:44:09.313
We traced their movements after the hotel.

00:44:10.397 --> 00:44:14.652
First, she was taken
to the university where he worked.

00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:19.531
After that, they went to the building
where they were found unconscious.

00:44:20.741 --> 00:44:25.496
Your wife may have gotten
mixed up in this case.

00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:30.668
I tried to tell you.

00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:34.963
But you wouldn't listen!

00:44:36.423 --> 00:44:42.721
We can't act without concrete evidence.

00:44:50.062 --> 00:44:51.146
May we ask you…

00:44:53.774 --> 00:44:56.443
to check your wife's belongings?

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:06.995
If something seems out of place,
please let us know.

00:45:59.131 --> 00:45:59.965
Well?

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:03.260
Notice anything?

00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:07.681
Your beloved will also be participating.

00:46:11.935 --> 00:46:13.270
No, nothing.

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:16.899
That Joker card…

00:46:17.649 --> 00:46:20.819
Matsuyama had one too.

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:30.579
Even if it seems absurd.

00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:33.081
"Absurd"?

00:46:33.165 --> 00:46:35.918
Something no one else would believe.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.003
"A far-off place"?

00:46:38.086 --> 00:46:40.088
That world is real.

00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:51.809
TAKINOGAWA SANATORIUM

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:00.818
This way.

00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:03.737
The train will be stopping…

00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:15.999
My wife is in a coma.

00:47:17.459 --> 00:47:18.627
And she's pregnant.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.589
But her heart may soon stop.

00:47:23.382 --> 00:47:25.008
It's only a matter of time.

00:47:27.636 --> 00:47:31.306
A guy gave me this yesterday.

00:47:34.268 --> 00:47:36.395
You told me about that world.

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:41.316
You said we fought there, survived,
and returned to this world.

00:47:43.235 --> 00:47:45.404
That guy said something similar.

00:47:47.406 --> 00:47:52.619
They might take my wife and child away
to that world.

00:47:55.455 --> 00:47:57.291
I know it sounds crazy.

00:47:58.667 --> 00:48:04.256
But I'd do anything
if there was a way to bring my wife back.

00:48:05.257 --> 00:48:06.258
Tell me.

00:48:14.933 --> 00:48:15.809
Two minutes.

00:48:16.935 --> 00:48:17.811
What?

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:22.858
Once someone goes into cardiac arrest,

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:28.280
they'll die if their heart doesn't
resume beating within two minutes.

00:48:28.947 --> 00:48:33.160
In the two minutes between cardiac arrest
and irreversible death,

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:37.956
I believe people enter
a shared consciousness.

00:48:39.666 --> 00:48:42.085
That's the world we experienced.

00:48:42.169 --> 00:48:46.757
If you go there
and bring her back within two minutes…

00:48:48.842 --> 00:48:50.552
she might survive.

00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:54.473
"Within two minutes"?

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:58.352
When we were there,

00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:00.812
it felt like a long time.

00:49:01.647 --> 00:49:08.153
But our hearts only stopped
for one minute.

00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:11.198
Time flows differently

00:49:11.698 --> 00:49:16.078
between the real world
and the shared consciousness.

00:49:17.537 --> 00:49:18.455
Two minutes.

00:49:19.373 --> 00:49:23.669
That moment in time
may feel like an eternity.

00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:29.508
Is that really possible?

00:49:30.425 --> 00:49:32.719
Isn't that why you're here?

00:49:37.015 --> 00:49:38.892
But I haven't tried it yet.

00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:43.397
There's no guarantee
you'll make it back alive.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.190
And if I don't make it back?

00:49:47.526 --> 00:49:49.027
You'll die, of course.

00:49:49.861 --> 00:49:54.491
And I'll be charged with
assisted suicide or murder.

00:50:07.129 --> 00:50:08.046
Yes?

00:50:10.757 --> 00:50:11.591
I see.

00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:19.433
Her heart stopped?

00:50:27.149 --> 00:50:28.483
I don't care if I die.

00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:32.779
If there's a chance I can save Usagi,

00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:34.906
I'll take it.

00:50:51.256 --> 00:50:53.759
INSULINACT

00:50:56.094 --> 00:50:57.220
That drug…

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.473
It will stop your heart

00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:01.308
on purpose.

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:02.517
Stop my heart?

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.478
No time to think.

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:05.479
Well?

00:51:13.987 --> 00:51:15.113
Two minutes.

00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:17.074
Right.

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:33.924
Feel anything?

00:51:34.007 --> 00:51:35.258
Nothing.

00:51:38.637 --> 00:51:40.347
We're running out of time!

00:51:47.854 --> 00:51:48.855
The clock…

00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:02.536
Ann?

00:52:07.541 --> 00:52:08.542
Ann?

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:20.947
PROCEED 15 KM SOUTH-SOUTHEAST
THE "GAME" STARTS AT SUNDOWN

00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:21.007
Usagi?

00:54:23.218 --> 00:54:30.225
THE "GAME" ARENA IS 6 KM AHEAD

00:54:51.371 --> 00:54:53.581
"GAME" ARENA AHEAD

00:56:32.263 --> 00:56:34.557
FRIED NOODLES

00:56:34.641 --> 00:56:36.101
COTTON CANDY

00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:51.741
Player quota reached.
Registration is now closed.

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:56.955
A new team has been formed
at Hikawa Shrine.

00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:09.426
The game will now commence.

00:59:51.462 --> 00:59:55.133
