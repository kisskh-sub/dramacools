00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.210
(This drama is based on
the 2018 cryptocurrency market.)

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.570
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.810
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.280
Is this for real?

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.610
We made it all the way here
through all that ice...

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.980
just to miss the last train.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.120
Are you kidding me?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.190
A cab will show up soon.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.760
I said we should've just walked.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.020
Are you crazy? It's minus 20Â°C.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.730
You two need to save money.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.190
It's the money you waste...

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.730
on taxis and deliveries
that's the real killer.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.800
Who knows what the future holds?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.370
How could you waste
your money like that?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.900
And how is the world
going to change?

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.300
A decentralized...

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.240
world of finance!

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.510
(Fun finance in a contactless world)

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.580
Soon,
with just a single virtual wallet,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.480
you will be able to make
transactions freely...

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.910
anywhere you want.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.220
Everyone will be desperate
to have digital assets.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.050
And you still don't want to invest?

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.320
- Do you want to be left behind?
- Eun Sang.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.350
(What remains after gambling
is social isolation.)

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.920
You're the one who's going
to be left behind.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.330
This isn't gambling!

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.630
So that's what you meant
by "one big score."

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.370
Look, whatever you want to call it,
let's not pursue a lost cause.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.500
If we're not going
to just quit here,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.640
we have to at least protect
what little we have.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.440
What do you even have to protect?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.580
- What?
- What?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.750
You said to protect what you have.
So what is it you actually have?

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.780
Youth? Beauty?

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.220
Our brilliant minds?

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.550
Our great skin?

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.960
I... I have my savings account,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.000
- and diligence!
- Okay.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.870
My integrity and hard work.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.800
I have my own assets, you know.
Like my work ethic.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.410
- Wipe your tears before you talk.
- I'm not crying.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.180
I mean, seriously, what are you two
going to do? What's your plan?

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.280
Fine, then. Just tell me.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.220
What?

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.050
That...

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.020
That crypto thing...
How does it work?

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.130
Okay, so here's the thing.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.330
(Episode 2:
Between Diligence and Inferiority)

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800
Watermelon.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.870
Applause.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.910
Towel.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.410
Health.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.610
Puppy.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.580
Puppy? Wait...

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.780
- Map?
- City.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.990
What could come after city?

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.660
I can't think of a word.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.160
- Just give me a second.
- Hurry, come up with a word.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.430
City...

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.140
- I don't want to!
- What?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.770
You're going to leave.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.170
It's your first time in my dream,

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.110
and if we finish this game,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.480
you're just going to leave,
aren't you?

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.880
Don't go.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.120
I told you,
Mommy can't think of one yet.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.020
After city...

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.320
City...

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.330
Right, a word that can come after...

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.330
Gosh.
Clock, market, stream, seed money.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.830
- See? There are plenty.
- What was that last one?

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.230
This is no time for crying.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.970
Did you scrape up the seed money?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.270
Your entry timing wasn't bad.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.410
What about your friends?
Aren't they in yet?

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.210
You need to get on the crypto train
while it's at a low.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.880
What are you talking about?

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.250
When you're buying,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.860
timing is everything.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.660
Once it hits a high point,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.560
I'll freeze everything for you.
Don't worry about it.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.100
Go on, hurry.
This is where it really begins.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.320
And now for our next story.
With financial markets struggling,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.390
cryptocurrency is gaining attention
as an alternative investment.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.960
The KOSPI and the won-dollar rate
have fallen in tandem,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.830
and the KOSPI has been fluctuating
around the 2,400-point mark,

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.170
remaining stuck in a frustratingly
narrow trading range.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.110
In this climate, some cryptos,
including Enderium,

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.380
are fueling anticipation
for a fresh start.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.610
The hope is that this signals
a change in the stagnant market.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.950
It's the start.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.620
And now for sports.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.620
Lee Sang Hwa at
the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games...

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.710
Get up, get up.
Didn't I tell you to fix this door?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.440
How could you leave
the door like that...

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.810
and possibly sleep with no worries?

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.410
Okay, that hurts.
Why are you making a fuss so early?

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.990
Darn it, I'm late. I'm so late.
Just a second.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.850
For crying out loud.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.630
My goodness.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.360
This place is a pigsty.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.870
Let's calm down.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.770
I have to be patient.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.800
She is not some wild animal.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.440
I fed her three square meals a day,

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.740
and I put her through school.
She's my daughter.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.180
What are you, a crow?

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.550
You were in there for two seconds,
and you're already out?

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.190
The bathroom has
no proper threshold.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.350
If I shower too long, it floods.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.160
Why don't you ever clean up?

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.330
The front door has no threshold.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.260
Dust from outside blows right in.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.230
Did you forget how a trash works?

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.900
Why do you just show up unannounced
and start nagging me?

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.170
I won't be long.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.640
I just stopped by on my way
to my doctor's appointment.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.280
- A doctor's appointment?
- Gosh.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.710
For your back?

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.180
Gosh.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.220
Stop just getting painkiller shots
and get some real treatment.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.720
Are you ever going to get married?

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.120
Where did that come from?

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.190
Mom, why does every talk with you
always have to end with marriage?

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.730
You should hurry up and get married
before Byeong Jun sees how you live.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.400
Lock him down and marry him already.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.530
Mom...

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.840
Mom, do we have a secret inheritance
I don't know about?

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.210
What?

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.110
Or that old chamber pot
in the family storage shed.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.480
Is it an antique
that can make us rich?

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.980
Was I the only one who didn't know?

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.150
What are you talking about?

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.950
You need money to get married.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.620
Who would marry me
when I have no money or anything?

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.090
Did he dump you?

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.700
She got dumped.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.400
That good-for-nothing jerk.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.070
How dare he dump my daughter?

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.940
There's nothing wrong with my baby!

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.340
Money. I'm short on money.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.820
That jerk...

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.460
Eat something before you go.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.390
It was your birthday, after all.
You should have some seaweed soup.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.070
But still, don't you dare
end up like your father.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.570
Even if you're not the best,
you just have to work hard in life.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.670
Got it?

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.210
Your dad has an incurable disease.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.880
He'll never be cured of it,
not in a million years.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.050
My dad had an illness.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.480
"Jackpot fever."

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.820
That's it.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.890
I'll raise cattle.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.590
With no job and nothing to his name,
my dad was obsessed with business.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.430
Always dreaming of
hitting the jackpot.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.600
One day,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.900
he declared he was going
to raise cows.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.800
Here's what he said.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.140
"Produce grown
while listening to classical music..."

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.640
"sold for big money."

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.010
"That's why
I'm going to raise cattle..."

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.410
"that grew up listening to K-pop."

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.810
He said fans would line up for beef
raised on their idol's music.

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.420
- But then...
- No way.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.350
- Unbelievable!
- After their idol's drug arrest,

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.690
they questioned the cattle's sanity
that had been raised on his music,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.130
which sparked a boycott...

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.500
of all products
he was associated with.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.800
The business failed spectacularly.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.800
But my dad didn't stop there.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.240
That's it. We're going to space.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.440
After learning a relative worked
at China's National Space Base,

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.250
he was once again swept up
in a new dream.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.410
He was going to build campers...

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.080
made out of
exterior materials for rockets.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.090
But then...

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.220
No way! Unbelievable

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.490
But when the rocket was shown live
exploding seconds after launch,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.800
the business went under once again.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.170
I'll be back when I've made it.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.240
(From Dad)

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.010
Where's Jung Yong Jik?

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.710
- Where is he?
- Wait a minute.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.680
What will you do about this?

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.980
My dad kept failing
until there was nothing left to lose.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.450
After my dad left home to chase
that darn dream of his,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.390
- we struggled just to get by.
- Here's your beer.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.060
- My beer?
- Yes, here's your beer.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.390
Here you go.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.760
- Yes, thank you.
- Be careful with that.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.360
Hey, you tramp!

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.430
Back then,
I only had one thing on my mind.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.740
I will never end up like my dad.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.970
And I'd avoid get-rich-quick schemes
like crypto.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.610
Just a second!

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.750
I made it.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.320
Gosh, I still can't believe I bought it
when I was so against it.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.060
- You crazy girl.
- Did you call for Maxbi?

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.260
Gosh, you scared me.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.300
I wasn't calling you.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.460
(Enderium)

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.570
I should just hurry up
and sell this thing.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.040
(Are you sure you want to sell?
Confirm to sell.)

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.110
- Thanks, Dad!
- Okay, be home early tonight.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.370
Okay, drive safe.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.080
Da Hae!

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.020
Fancy meeting you here.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.220
Good morning.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.120
- A beautiful morning, isn't it?
- What?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.690
A "beautiful" morning
on my way to work?

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.930
Not unless you got shot in the head.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.800
I brought you a coffee.
This is for you.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.100
- Thanks.
- Let's hurry inside.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.880
- Stop the unfair layoffs!
- Stop them now!

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.610
- Protect our livelihoods!
- Protect them now!

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.280
- Guarantee our job security!
- Guarantee it now!

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.750
Ms. Round.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.290
"Masijokko?"

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.320
Yes.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.360
To appeal to people of all ages,

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.860
our snack's name should be simple
and intuitive.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.230
And to clearly emphasize that
it's a chicken-based snack,

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.040
"Masijokko."

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.470
What better name conveys
the meaning...

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.610
"A tasty chicken-flavored snack?"

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.310
Was that too over-the-top?

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.550
Isn't it a little plain?
There's intuitive, then uninspired.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.650
I think we need to be more creative
and more artistic, don't you think?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.190
I feel like there's something better
out there.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.830
Don't just criticize.
Offer a solution, then.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.800
Does anyone have any other
suggestions, then?

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.330
What if we make a small tweak?

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.930
- A tweak?
- Yes.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:19.670
It's a pun in Korean,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.470
so by changing one small particle,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.570
it goes from just "tastes good,"

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.440
to implying "The taste is good,
and it lifts your spirits too."

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.880
It kills two birds with one stone.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.150
- Just by changing one particle...
- I like it.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.580
Yes, changing the particle...

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.720
makes it feel
so much fresher, right?

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.520
Yes.
It means more than "tastes good."

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.160
Da Hee, you've got great instincts.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.190
Gosh, who's this genius
in our hiring class?

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.330
That would be the 14th rookie class.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.770
The 14th! We're fast! Let's go!

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:50.870
Let's win!

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.930
(3 years ago)

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.670
- Yes.
- Yes!

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.670
- Go, 14th!
- Go, 14th!

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.570
(Welcome Employees
of Marron Confectionery!)

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.240
Da Hae, what are you doing
over there?

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.650
What hiring class were you in again?
Were you here before us?

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.650
The 12th? Or the 13th?

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.450
I'm...

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.220
I don't think I saw her
at orientation.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.390
I'm sorry.
My foot's kind of bothering me.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.460
I'm just going to go rest
over there.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.490
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.070
Esteemed executives and employees,

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.700
on this beautiful autumn day,

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.040
it's a great pleasure to see
all of you gathered here together.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.510
Excuse me. Is it okay if I sit here?

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.710
Oh, these seats are reserved
for our class.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.310
A time to look back on the path
we have walked together...

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.880
Hey, this is my seat.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.490
And to resolve to make new plans
for the future.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.850
- What about here?
- Sorry.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.020
Hey, you!
Why are you still standing?

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.160
Hurry up and sit down!

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:00.640
What's this?

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.770
She just created a chair
out of thin air.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.140
A true master of creativity.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.980
It's nothing special.
It's quite simple.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.150
I just endured, and endured.
That is how I've persevered.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.390
Enduring for three days straight.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.890
Enduring until you feel you'll die.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.460
Enduring until you're about to cry,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.720
- What will she do?
- and enduring...

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.860
till your tears dry up.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.800
You endure it and endure it...

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.800
That is how I've managed to endure.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.510
That day,
sitting on that invisible chair,

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.810
I foresaw my own opaque future,

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.510
the miserable, wretched future
that awaits a private hire.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.520
And for some reason,
bad feelings are never wrong.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.450
All right, let's add today's names
to the list of candidates.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.390
- Okay.
- Thanks for your hard work.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.430
Da Hee and Ms. Round...

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.060
For the Children's Day proposals...

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.030
Both of your proposals
have been selected as finalists.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.430
Oh my gosh, really?

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.240
If this goes well, it's a fast track
to Assistant Manager, right?

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.840
What? I've applied for
the last three years...

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.510
and have been rejected every time.
I actually got picked?

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.710
I pushed for you two.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.740
A chance like this has come my way?

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.450
Is this for real?

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.080
Ms. Round? Why are you so quiet?

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.450
Are you happy about this or what?

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.150
Ms. Round?

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.490
Well...

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.320
- Jackpot!
- It's a jackpot, right?

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:28.890
All right, let's wrap this up.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.630
Great work, everyone.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.900
Mr. Ko!

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.600
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.700
I guess it's true
that every dog has its day.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.170
All right. Let's do this!

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.810
Promotion for Jung Da Hae.
Let's get it!

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.650
- Ji Song.
- Yes?

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.590
- Can you grab my copies for me?
- Okay.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.660
- Hey, Ji Song?
- Yes!

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.030
Can you take this
to the Sales Department?

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.390
- Sure.
- Ji Song?

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.490
- Yes?
- Can you prep...

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:06.500
- the conference room?
- Sure.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.760
- Ji Song, can you get me a coffee?
- Sure.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.270
- (- Those are so pretty.
- Whose are they? DM me.)

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.410
(Wei Lin)

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.840
Your shoes are pretty,
and you are too, honey.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.420
This is why I love
buying new things.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.950
Looks like you bought new shoes,
Ji Song.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.420
I did! Aren't they pretty?

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:31.550
Yes.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.360
- But can you even work in those?
- Excuse me?

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.330
I know I wouldn't be able to
get any work done in those.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.670
Then again, not that you do much
around here anyway.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.200
What do you mean?

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.170
I have plenty of receipts
I have to paste for expenses.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:51.910
And they're comfier than they look.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.280
Right, but don't you get anxious...

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.680
just doing menial work like that?

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.350
Even I worry, and I'm a full-timer.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.480
You must have so much on your mind.

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:08.760
You know,

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.530
maybe that's why
I don't look my age.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.430
Because I don't worry.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.800
What?

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:17.530
Well...

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.070
Worrying causes wrinkles, right?

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.440
One day, like you,
Assistant Manager Jo,

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.540
the time will come
when I'll have to start worrying.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.840
Gosh, just thinking about it
is terrifying.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.550
And what exactly am I supposed
to be worried about?

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.450
Your wrinkles.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.720
Isn't that what
you were referring to?

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.620
Goodness.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.060
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I assumed that's what you meant...

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.400
That's not it at all.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.960
I'm so sorry.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.970
- I'm so sorry.
- That girl...

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.040
Do I have wrinkles? Are they bad?

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.100
Take a look.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.410
Oh my gosh!

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.880
Ms. Eun Sang,
you can't go in that stall.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.280
What in the world!

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.380
It's been like that since yesterday.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.820
Seriously, I thought a cow used it.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.620
But why would they just
leave it like that?

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.750
The cleaning staff is on strike,
remember?

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.620
Plus, that's not a cleaning job.
It needs to be unclogged.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.860
I totally lost my appetite.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.230
I've not eaten
since lunch yesterday.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.000
Same here.
I can't even think about food.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.070
It's just awful.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.240
Ms. Eun Sang, what are you doing?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.340
Hey, don't do it, Ms. Eun Sang.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.840
- What are you thinking?
- Don't!

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.680
What do we have besides our lunch?

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.450
I won't let this clog ruin it.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.950
- Ms. Eun Sang!
- Ms. Eun Sang!

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.850
Whatever you hear, don't panic.
Just stay back.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.120
- Goodness.
- Okay.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.830
What in the... Oh, gosh!

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.570
- Go down! Just go down!
- Ms. Eun Sang!

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.630
Go down!

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.300
- Is it overflowing?
- Ms. Eun Sang, are you okay?

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.770
- Are you okay?
- Stay back! Oh, darn it!

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.750
Go ahead and take care of business.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.050
Oh my gosh, what would we have done
without you, Eun Sang?

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.690
- Seriously.
- You're the best! The best!

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.890
The best!

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.660
Oh, when did you guys get here?

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.190
You're something else.
How did you even unclog that thing?

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.660
I'm so nauseous.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.100
I'm about to throw up my formula.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.230
Come on, you're all being dramatic.
Let's just go eat.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.500
How can you even think
about food right now?

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.040
I'm buying.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.110
Make way.
The one who pays is coming through.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.410
Yes!

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.510
Clear the way.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.190
Let's eat!

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.360
- Thanks for the meal!
- Thanks for the meal!

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.930
What's gotten into you?

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.360
Our penny-pincher is
paying the bill.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.570
Oh, come on, it's no big deal.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.300
Whose foot is that?

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.800
- Whose foot is on my lap?
- What?

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.140
Oh, sorry.
I was just trying to stretch.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.110
Seriously...

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.280
My feet are killing me.
My new shoes aren't broken in yet.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.580
New shoes? You bought new shoes?

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.590
The FW limited-edition collection.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.460
They're pretty.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.190
Hey, how much?

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.100
Isn't it weird?
Why do new things drop on rent day?

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.800
You're saying they cost
a month's rent?

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.430
That's a ridiculous price
for someone in your situation.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.200
Look,
if I actually lived within my means,

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.840
I'd be homeless at Seoul Station
with some guy named Mr. Kim

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.610
and living off free meals
at a church.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.540
Then go live like that,
you little brat.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.680
I can't.
I went to a Buddhist kindergarten.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:29.080
Hey.
If you don't want it to be a luxury,

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.520
do you know what you have to do?

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.120
- What?
- How?

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.230
You have to make more money.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.130
Exactly. How do I make more money?

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.430
Not this again.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.330
Yes. We're talking about
crypto again.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.210
You seemed so ready to jump in.
So, what happened?

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.870
Oh, me? Well...

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:53.980
Hey!

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.640
You really think Da Hae is like you?

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.280
She wouldn't fall for instant wealth
and invest in crypto.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.580
Right, Da Hae?

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.620
Yes, well... Right.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.550
I am a bit more susceptible.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.490
- Yes.
- I'd be crazy

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.530
if I weren't profiting. But I am.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.330
This is how I'm able to treat you.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.360
Now, gather around.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.670
Have you guys ever heard
of something called a J-Curve?

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.840
- A J-Curve?
- Even when it's in total freefall,

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.450
it eventually hits an upward curve.
That's what a J-Curve is.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.280
It's sort of a pattern.
And right now, the trend is...

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.350
just like this.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.550
So it's like a diet, right?

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.990
You might think you hit a plateau,

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.960
but if you stick to your diet
and exercise,

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.030
you'll eventually lose weight,
right?

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.660
Exactly.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.000
See? Just look.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.370
- We can make money.
- That's the J?

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.270
(Enderium)

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.910
- But it's plummeting.
- What?

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.410
Oh!

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.640
You know what this means?

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.050
It means it's hit rock bottom,
and now the only way to go is up.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.520
A true J.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.520
- Oh, give me a break.
- What?

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.360
E Rin, what are you up to?

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.760
Ji Song, you get it, right?
Ji Song! Kim Ji Song.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.090
Hey, you get it, right?

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.930
When is it supposed to become a J?

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.770
No, forget it.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.170
I don't have time for this.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.870
I have to get back to work. Work.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.680
- Da Hae, have you had lunch?
- Yes.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.380
Looks like you're prepping
for the presentation.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.150
By the way,
who's judging the PTs this time?

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.020
The executive directors and Dr. Ham.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.520
Dr. Ham?

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.590
Oh, I love him.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.790
What? Not even hiding it, are you?

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.920
I have a condition where I get giddy
just thinking about handsome men.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.830
Excuse me, but who's Dr. Ham?

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.730
Oh, right. You're an intern,
Ye Jin, so you wouldn't know.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.030
Let's just say...

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.100
he's our executive director
and a living legend.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.510
You know Choco Cup, right?

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.150
It's our company's bestseller now,

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.150
but we were worried
before its launch.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.690
Our first new product in years.
"How do we make sure it sells?"

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.860
Or, "How do we make it sell
even better?"

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.460
All the vice presidents
had intense, cutthroat meetings,

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.500
but they just weren't
getting anywhere.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.870
- Wait!
- And right then,

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.670
Dr. Ham, who'd been silent
the whole time, said...

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.440
How about we draw a line?

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.070
Let's call it...

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.340
The Conscience Line.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.250
In an age of deception and rip-offs,
you can't tell what's in the bag.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.750
Where is that thing? Oh, here.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:55.590
A line was drawn on the bag.
"We promise snacks up to this line."

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.630
- A.K.A. The Conscience Line.
- And that was Dr. Ham's idea?

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:00.800
Yes.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.570
And this idea, as cool as Dr. Ham,

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.270
caused a huge sensation
as soon as it was released.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.640
But what made this campaign
a massive hit was...

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.870
because of what happened recently.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:12.940
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.950
Yes, her opponent under-rotated,
but no points were deducted.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.950
This is a clear case
of biased judging.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:21.450
- Yes.
- But then...

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.750
A doping scandal broke.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.650
Oh, it's a gold medal!

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.020
A gold medal for South Korea!

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:32.460
Thanks to that, our silver medalist
rightfully won back the gold medal.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:37.130
Are you all watching this?
Our conscience has triumphed.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.730
At this point, you'd have to say
the universe is on Dr. Ham's side.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.840
It's like he descended to Earth,
blessed with cosmic energy.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.470
So...

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:51.950
So it's like a creation myth,
like he was hatched from an egg.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.020
I'm just saying he's on that level.
He's an incredible guy.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.490
But why do you call him "Doctor?"
Does he have a Ph.D.?

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:00.560
Well, that and other things.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.460
Even when he was a regular employee,
he created so many hit products.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.230
So the CEO started calling him,
"Gosh, our Dr. Ham..."

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.330
and doted on him like a grandson.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.170
When he was promoted to Director,

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:17.170
he didn't want to be part of the
company's rigid hierarchy, and so...

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.980
the name "Doctor Ham" just stuck.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.680
He really is an incredible guy.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.980
But Da Hae,
didn't you say you met him...

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.150
during your job interview?

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.250
Yes.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.450
I doubt he'd remember me, though.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.760
I guess so.
You do have a pretty generic look.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.360
Gosh, I didn't see that coming.
That one stung.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.060
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:46.000
But still,
he does seem pretty incredible.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.010
It sounds like he's untouchable.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.690
It's time for the all-hands meeting.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.930
(I want to clock out and lie down.
I want to sleep. I want to go home.)

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.200
You seem to be in a good mood.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.500
- You've been humming all morning.
- I have?

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:22.570
You have.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.010
I guess I have. That...

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.310
What song is stuck in my head?

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:29.410
Absurdity!

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.680
What's this?
Isn't this our inventory list?

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.990
- Is this from Assistant Manager Oh?
- Looks like it.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:40.720
- Give Assistant Manager Oh a call.
- Okay.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.500
He's not picking up.
He also left his laptop behind.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.960
Where is Assistant Manager Oh?
Find him now.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.400
He can't be far. I'll just...

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.370
Ji Song?

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.380
- Yes?
- Ji Song, you go after him.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.850
Go on, you're wearing
comfortable shoes!

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:06.950
Me?

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.130
Assistant Manager Oh! Wait up!

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.990
Wait!

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.610
Excuse me. Coming through!
Sorry about that.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.480
Okay, thanks. Assistant Manager Oh!

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.720
Assistant Manager Oh!

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.620
Wait!

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.070
Darn it.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.450
Assistant Manager Oh!

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.120
Wait!

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.480
Assistant Manager Oh!

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.050
Wait!

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.160
Assistant Manager Oh...

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:33.800
Ji Song!

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.600
- Here...
- What?

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:37.670
You left this...

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.410
Ji Song, did you follow me
all the way out here?

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.410
You...

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:46.910
One second.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:49.950
Hello?

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.520
- Hello?
- Ji Song?

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.690
I just got off the phone with him.
He said the files were in his bag.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.860
So you can come back to the office.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.870
- Ji Song, are you all right?
- Yes.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.600
On my way over here,

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:14.710
- I think I might've broken my toes.
- What?

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.680
Could you help me find them?

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.580
My shoes...

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:28.460
Who does she think she is,
acting up like that?

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.300
Why would you let someone
like her mess with you? Darn it.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.410
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.720
Come on, stand up properly.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.190
I can't put any weight on my toes.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.250
Da Hae, please call a cab for me.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.220
Your place is just around the corner.
We're not calling a cab.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.860
I can't take another single step.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.400
- You're so heavy!
- That hurts!

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.700
Hey!

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.730
- What?
- There, that's it.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.780
Look at those old ladies.
That's hilarious!

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.920
You're totally lying about
that "one meal a day," aren't you?

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.950
It's more like
"one meat meal a day," right?

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.320
Save your breath.
It just makes this harder.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.820
Drivers,
a little more gently, please.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.430
The suspension on this thing
is terrible.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.700
Excuse me, ma'am.
Will your life cover the fare?

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.030
No. This is a memory in the making,
so let's take a picture. Come on.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.270
Okay! One, two, three! Smile!

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.340
Just drop dead.

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.940
Will you snap out of it?
Want me to just dump you?

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.710
No! Why would you dump Ji Song?

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.780
You're the best! I'm so touched.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.280
- She has to do crypto with us too.
- This is so freaking annoying.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.250
Crypto this, crypto that.
Why don't you just do it yourself?

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.650
- Why keep pushing me into this?
- I can't do it alone.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.160
- Why? Why can't you?
- Hey!

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.460
Oh, no. What do I do?

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.980
Eun Sang!
What did I do? I'm so sorry!

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.050
I'm so sorry!

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:35.720
Eun Sang!

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:36.880
Are you okay?

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:40.290
I can't bear to watch...

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.190
to see you two collapse.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:44.090
If we keep on like this,

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.930
what other outcome can there be?

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.660
Nothing but ruin.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.930
Is there any other story left
for us to write?

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.800
I see what's coming,
and I can't just ignore it.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.970
I won't let that happen to you two!

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.510
Be careful. Please be careful.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:05.880
Please, be careful.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.020
- Eun Sang!
- Let's go.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:15.160
(Marron Confectionery)

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.660
(Marron Confectionery
and Sahara Trading MOU Signing)

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.900
He looks forward to our partnership.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.140
We look forward to working with you.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.840
The pleasure is all ours.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.940
- We will do our absolute best.
- Thank you.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.280
Excuse me, just a moment.
Sir, one moment, please.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:42.280
Mr. Cheon, our restaurant called.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.620
Their refrigerator broke down,

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.750
and they're asking if we can
push our reservation back an hour.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.720
What? What's the plan?
Find another restaurant nearby fast.

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.630
I'm trying, but they're Muslim.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.960
A Halal restaurant
takes time to find.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.600
A Korean BBQ place?

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.830
At a BBQ place, the exhaust hoods
make it hard to talk face-to-face.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.840
What do we do now?

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.410
- I'm sorry, sir.
- What are we going to do?

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.070
So...

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.580
Right this way, please.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:19.950
Is this the restaurant?

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:21.760
I'd like to offer you an appetizer.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.430
- An appetizer?
- Yes.

00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:28.800
Using Marron's products,

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.830
I'd like to create
a one-of-a-kind appetizer...

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.330
exclusively for you.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:42.980
With Marron's products?

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.250
You mean with snacks?
Is that possible?

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:47.820
We certainly can.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.920
First, we have one of
Marron's most popular products,

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:53.790
the Milk Tarte.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.020
(Milk Tarte)

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:02.860
On top, we'll add some peach jam
that was launched this year.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:06.500
Then, just pop it in the microwave
for exactly 40 seconds...

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.710
Voila, the Milk Tarte Peach Tart
is complete.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.750
This ice bar, the Kkeukkeuryu Bar,

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.550
sold over 100,000 on its first day.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.390
(Kkeukkeuryu bar)

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.160
Open it and drop it into a glass
of sparkling water full of ice.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.840
And there you have
a tasty non-alcoholic cocktail...

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.000
you can even enjoy at the office.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.180
He says it's quite delicious.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.790
- Delicious, he says.
- And isn't it charming?

00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:59.690
And now, for the grand finale.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.690
To our cookies-and-cream ice cream,
we'll add Marron's Ppeppe Stick,

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:05.590
our Bincheu Bencheu,

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.500
and our soon-to-be-released
secret weapon!

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.770
- Our Chocolate Marshmallow...
- Stop!

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.080
Don't marshmallows use pork gelatin?

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.780
Our client doesn't eat pork.

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:32.850
Now what do we do?

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:43.500
At Marron Confectionery,
we use Halal-certified beef gelatin.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.980
We should head to the restaurant.
It's all ready for us. Shall we?

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.120
- Lunch time.
- Right this way.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.420
Yes, right this way. Ms. Eun Sang.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:16.530
- Peace be upon you.
- My brother!

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.600
- Eun Sang, you did a great job.
- Thanks.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.210
The buyer was singing your praises.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.540
He's planning on visiting
again next year,

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.450
and he asked if
you'd still be here then.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.010
Well, of course...

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.390
- Actually, no.
- What?

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.790
I'm not even sure about tomorrow,
so how can I promise next year?

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.030
So you might be leaving?

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.930
That's a shame.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.100
The company needs someone like you.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.130
I don't know about that.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.070
Everyone's replaceable.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:01.040
- Protect our livelihoods!
- Protect them now!

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.880
- Guarantee our job security!
- Guarantee it now!

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.280
- Ms. Eun Sang, you should go.
- Some other time.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.080
Right.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.820
If you do end up leaving,
do you have any other plans?

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:15.390
- To the moon.
- I'm sorry?

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.590
That's where I'm going.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.090
Where?

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.230
Up there.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.860
All the way to the moon.

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:30.570
Let's do this!

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.340
Let's nail this Children's Day,
the retail industry's high season!

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.050
Marron's bestselling Choco Cup,
and the kids' hero, Yongki.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.580
Yongki, the beloved character,
and our Choco Cup have teamed up.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.150
Darn it.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:52.760
Featuring his signature white pearls
and a touch of white chocolate.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.500
It's the Yongki Special Edition.

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:57.930
Plus a special edition.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.400
Children's Day...

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.000
Excuse me.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:03.770
(Children's Day Promotion Proposal)

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.180
Da Hee, what are you doing here?

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.050
Didn't you already clock out?

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:15.020
I forgot my umbrella.
Preparing for the presentation?

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.450
Yes. Just a little.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.120
Perfect timing.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:23.890
I brought some coffee
for everyone working late.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.290
Here, this one's for you, Da Hae.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.930
Thank you.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.070
Of course.
Good luck with your presentation.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:33.130
You got this!

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.200
But wait.

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:42.680
You sound
as if you're not working on it too.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.250
Of course,
I'm working hard on it too.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:49.080
But I've already done my best,

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.920
so I'll have no regrets
if I don't get it.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:55.420
There's always a next time. Right?

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:02.000
- Must be nice.
- Sorry?

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:05.700
The luxury of trying again
even if you fail...

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:07.200
makes me jealous.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:14.680
Never mind.
You came back for your umbrella.

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.340
Right! I should get going.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:18.450
See you tomorrow.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:49.810
Okay. Let's do this.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.720
Let's nail this Children's Day,
the retail industry's high season!

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.650
Marron Confectionery's bestseller...

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:01.220
Just in time for Children's Day,
the retail industry's high season,

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.960
Marron Confectionery's
bestselling Choco Cup...

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.560
and the hero Yongki...

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.590
- have teamed up.
- Mom, did you grab the passports?

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.660
- Of course I did.
- The retail market's high season...

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:12.200
When Yu Jin's mom heard I was going
to Da Nang, she was so jealous.

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.170
You told her about it?
Of course I did.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.670
- Let's hurry
- Gosh, it's so pretty.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.280
You need money to get married.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.220
Who would marry me
when I have no money or anything?

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.570
Hi, Mom.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:51.100
Have you eaten?

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:58.180
No, I was just wondering
if you got your back looked at.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.650
It felt better when I woke up,
so I just skipped it.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.590
What? Why would you just skip it?
Since when are you a doctor?

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.290
I told you to go
get it treated properly.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.590
Oh, forget it.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:12.630
I think I know my own body.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.500
I have to work. I'm hanging up.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.360
Mom, just listen. Hello? Mom.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.670
Hey, be quiet!

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.570
- Gosh!
- I said to be quiet, darn it.

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.110
Unbelievable.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:26.610
What's his problem?

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.680
(Children's Day Promotion
Presentation Script)

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:39.920
Almost done. Okay.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.500
Yongki and Choco Cup
have come together.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.270
Maybe I should add a little echo?

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.870
Have come together...

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:07.610
Hey, you!

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.520
What? Who's there?
What are you doing?

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.720
Hey, open up!

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:14.250
Oh my gosh.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.760
You were staring at me earlier.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.430
Open the door!

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.030
What do you think you're doing?
Go away.

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.100
Open up.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:27.070
You were staring at me, weren't you?
Why the dirty look?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.540
I said go away! Please, just go.

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.280
- Open up.
- My laptop...

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.340
Open it.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.180
(Marron Confectionery)

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:40.710
- All of my files are on there.
- Open up.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.150
Come on, open the door.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.620
Open it.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:46.750
Oh no.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.220
No, this can't be happening.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.060
Open the door!

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.690
What if my laptop breaks?

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:54.490
If my files are gone,
I can't present anything.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.200
If I can't present, no promotion!

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.230
And no promotion means no raise.

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:01.370
How can I pay for Mom's treatment?
No, wait.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:05.910
I can't even afford to fix my phone.
Maybe I can get it fixed for free?

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:08.510
Wait a second. My phone?

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.510
- You crazy girl.
- Did you call for Maxbi?

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:14.580
My phone!

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.980
Come on, open up.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:18.990
Hey, Maxbi! Call 112 for me.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.420
- Calling 112.
- Open the darn door.

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:23.790
(Emergency number 112)

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.460
112 Emergency Dispatch.
What's your emergency?

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.900
Help me, please!

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.370
Okay, for now, everyone can go home.
We'll be in touch tomorrow.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:40.210
Make sure that jerk faces justice.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.340
Or I'll deal with him myself.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.440
Yes, ma'am.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:45.550
She means it.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.380
She'll rip a person to shreds.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:53.820
Yes, we'll do our best.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:55.960
All right, then.

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:59.090
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.560
Are you okay?

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:09.270
The file I was working on is gone.
I have to start all over.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.470
The jerk...

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.910
That jerk. Tearing him apart
would be too good for him.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.020
What are you working on?

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:30.120
Crying won't solve anything.
We have to redo it, and fast.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.730
Gungseo or Myeongjo font?
What do you think?

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.130
- Myeongjo.
- Myeongjo font?

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.700
You have no idea how scared I was.

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:46.540
Don't you think left-aligning this
is easier to read?

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.780
- Center it.
- Center?

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.610
I have to do it all over again.
That jerk!

00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:59.950
Does this look better in blue?

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.920
Gosh.

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:04.460
Yes, I guess blue is better.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:07.790
Pick an attitude and stick with it.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:11.770
I can't tell if you're frustrated,
so it's a little confusing for us.

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:14.300
Fine. My attitude, then...

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.240
will be a J-curve.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.640
What?

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:21.910
You said it yourself.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:27.010
Even when it looks like a free fall,
it'll eventually shoot back up.

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.880
That's the J-curve.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.050
That's me.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:32.920
At the end of this adversity,

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.790
there's got to be a happy ending
waiting for me.

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.060
I can feel it.

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:42.830
To do that, you must first learn
how to trade crypto properly.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.200
I will work really hard.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.470
I'm going to give it my all.

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.410
Just don't get nervous.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.280
Okay, breathe.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.050
I'll do it. I can do this.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.450
Okay, you got this.
Breathe in and out.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.520
I can do this.

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.120
In and out.
Exhale. Just keep breathing.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:10.720
(Touch the crazy girl
who lives here, and you're dead!)

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.690
Those jerks!

(Marron Confectionery)

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:21.700
We will now begin the presentations
for the Children's Day promotion.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.470
First, we have Ms. Jung Round...

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.540
Ms. Jung Da Hae will present.

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:56.070
Absurdity?

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:58.270
Excuse me?

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:03.810
Director Ham?
Did you have anything to say first?

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.080
No. Please, start.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:08.780
Yes.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:14.220
In celebration of Children's Day,
the retail industry's high season,

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.820
Marron's bestselling Choco Cup...

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.060
teams up with the beloved Yongki.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:22.360
For Children's Day,
we present the Yongki Special Edition.

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:25.430
I will now walk you through
the details.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.740
(Choco Cup and Yongki Collaboration)

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:32.010
The Yongki Special Edition,
a limited Children's Day release...

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.640
That concludes my presentation.

00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:46.090
What was that?

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.520
Did that go well,
or did I totally bomb?

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.490
I can't read their faces at all.

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:59.430
Next, Ms. Jung Da Hee will present.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.400
Hold on.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.140
Is that it for me? Just like that?

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.880
If you don't mind,

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:17.120
could I please get some feedback?

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:22.990
If there's anything I can improve,
I worked really hard preparing this.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:24.420
I'm sure you did.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.700
I interviewed you
three years ago, right?

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:30.630
Yes.

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:35.840
I thought you looked familiar.
Now I remember why.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:44.480
Thank you.
I will do my absolute best.

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.010
I promise I'll work really hard.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.450
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.250
- You should go to the hospital.
- I'll work hard.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:58.990
And it seems you've just kept
"working hard" ever since.

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:02.530
Thank you.

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:04.430
But by now,

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.200
shouldn't diligence be the process,
not the result?

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:11.540
If all you have to show is,
"I worked really hard,"

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.070
- then that's just...
- Who do you think you are?

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:15.940
- Feedback? It was terrible.
- It was... How do I put this?

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.680
- It's...
- Go back to your seat. Quickly.

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.020
Learn to read the room.

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:29.390
Da Hee, congratulations!
Congrats, Da Hee!

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.860
Cheer up, baby

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.990
Just hang in a little bit more

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.260
A girl shouldn't give her heart away
so easily

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.300
So you'll fall for me even more

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:45.410
I'll act nonchalant,
like I don't care at all

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:48.380
So you won't know how I feel

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:49.780
Just get it together

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.080
And then, baby, cheer up

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.850
She's so pretty.

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:59.550
All right.
Come on, everyone, have a drink.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.290
To our Marketing Team!

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:03.820
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.660
Ms. Round!
It's your turn for a song. Let's go!

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:13.230
Mr. Ko!

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:16.970
Do you really think Da Hae
is in the mood for that right now?

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.610
Come on, this is just
part of the job, right?

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.910
You win some, you lose some.

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:24.810
Just because of one setback,

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.650
is she going to
make everyone uncomfortable

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:29.680
and have us all walk on eggshells
around her?

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.990
Okay.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:41.900
- I'll sing a song.
- All right! A round of applause!

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.950
In a corner of the pre-dawn sky

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:06.250
A shooting star suddenly appears

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:09.490
In the blink of an eye

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.190
Right above my head

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:17.600
Raining down on me like light

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:22.500
What a beautiful day

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:29.510
The sun and moon are on my side,
shining just for me

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:34.310
Please love me

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:38.850
Into my empty heart

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:43.860
Is now filled with shining stars

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.280
You went through so much.

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:08.210
You worked really hard too, Ye Jin.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.890
- Being an intern is hard, isn't it?
- Not tougher than your ordeal.

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:17.090
After the hardship you went through,

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:19.230
you got rejected for not being
a permanent employee.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.630
I guess I'm a good punching bag.

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:31.300
Everyone's really hitting me
where it hurts today.

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:34.740
But, Ye Jin...

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:39.310
- It's not because I'm a temp...
- No, I overheard something.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:43.180
They said this whole presentation
was rigged for the direct hires.

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:47.020
We were just there
to make them look good.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:50.490
Apparently, everyone knew
except for us.

00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:56.530
I'm quitting after my internship.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.300
There's no way I can make it here...

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:04.170
as a temp hire.

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:10.980
Sorry. It happens.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.750
If you're sorry, then come with us.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.670
Come on, let's all do a cheer!
You have to drink with the group.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.830
I'll head home early.

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:06.630
Okay, I will, Dad.

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.100
Okay.

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:15.310
Da Hae? What are you doing out here?

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.680
Why'd you do it?

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:21.410
What?

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:25.850
Telling me "good luck"
the day before the presentation,

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.790
were you just mocking me?

00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:32.530
Because you knew
I didn't stand a chance.

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:35.700
Da Hae, you've had a lot to drink.
Are you okay?

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.670
No, I'm not just saying this
because I'm drunk...

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.270
Fine.

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:47.540
Since I'm drunk anyway,
I might as well keep rambling.

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.840
Why am I the only one
who gets an Americano?

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:58.620
Everyone else gets their
Frappes and Lattes.

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:02.720
You get them whatever they want
from the menu,

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:05.530
but why do you always...

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:10.260
fob me off with
the "buy ten, get one free" coffee?

00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.370
I brought you a coffee.
This is for you.

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:14.530
I brought everyone a coffee.

00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:16.140
Here, this one's for you, Da Hae.

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:18.640
Goodness, I'm sorry.

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:21.440
You never said anything
when I gave you an Americano, so...

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:25.450
But you always asked everyone else
what they wanted to drink.

00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:27.310
You asked them.

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:31.780
I'm not sure why I did that...

00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:33.150
But I do.

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:36.720
I know why you did it.

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:39.930
It's because...

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:44.330
I'm the kind of person
it's okay to treat that way.

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:50.900
That's why...

00:56:52.610 --> 00:56:53.970
the presentation...

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:55.910
Everyone just...

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.580
looks down on me.

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:03.920
They treat me like I'm nothing.

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:07.550
I'm so sorry.

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:11.220
But I thought you liked Americanos.

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:12.730
I really didn't mean anything by it.

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:14.460
Yes, I can tell.

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.500
You don't look to be the type
to hold a grudge,

00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:21.030
or bitter...

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.810
Your life doesn't seem hard enough
for that, Da Hee.

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:30.180
Which actually pisses me off
even more, though.

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.350
It's just the alcohol talking.

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:41.890
Just forget I said anything.

00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:49.300
Da Hae!
But you really did work hard on it.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.130
Let's both try even harder
from now on.

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:53.800
We've got this!

00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.670
- "Harder?"
- You're just so kind!

00:57:57.270 --> 00:58:00.770
Even if you're not the best,
you just have to work hard in life.

00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:01.910
Stop it.

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:05.950
Finish the presentation this week.
It's a fast track to the promotion.

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:07.180
I said, stop it.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:08.850
After the hardship you went through,

00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:10.650
you got rejected for not being
a permanent employee.

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.980
Diligence...

00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:13.550
I can't.

00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:17.360
Let's both try even harder
from now on.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.190
I'm not doing it anymore.

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:22.800
I said I'm not doing it anymore.

00:58:57.330 --> 00:58:59.900
I almost hit innocent Da Hee.

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:05.040
For three years, I'd endured my job,
feeling my spirit sink lower daily.

00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:09.610
In the end, my diligence
had become my inferiority.

00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:32.400
Jung Da Hae, you've really...

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.470
hit rock bottom now.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.310
Kang Eun Sang.

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:23.250
Nothing's going right.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.550
Not a single thing.
Not a darn thing.

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.560
- I can see that.
- But...

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:33.060
Turns out one thing
is actually going my way.

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:37.460
Look at that, a J-curve.

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:40.330
Gosh, what's this?

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:43.970
Eun Sang. I...

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.570
I was hoping my career
would hit a J-curve.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.680
But that darn J-curve
showed up here instead.

01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:58.850
While my life is hitting
absolute rock bottom.

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:03.820
Even at a tragic time like this,
the only thing on the rise is that.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.220
This darn crypto.

01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:06.790
Did you only put in ten bucks?

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:10.260
Hey, that was a big spend for me.
Gosh.

01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:11.960
I'll bet.

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:13.470
Hey.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.040
I just don't know anymore.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.170
Should I be happy about this
or angry?

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:25.080
Be happy, of course.
Money goes to those who love it.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.550
I made 50 cents.
Is this why everyone's into crypto?

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.820
That's because
you only put in ten...

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.990
How much cash do you have
on you right now?

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.490
I've got 1.50 dollars.

01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:38.090
I couldn't even buy
a single bottle of soju.

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.060
That's something to be proud of.
Seriously.

01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:43.630
Okay, so you made 50 cents
from crypto.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.400
So now you have two bucks, right?

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.170
Look, I get it.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.040
Nothing's going your way,
and you're pissed off.

01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:57.180
So you think you can take it out
on some innocent person.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.710
Snap out of it, girl!

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.420
Gosh, you scared me.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.650
A presentation can't change
your life.

01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:06.220
Here, eat this.

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:07.920
You need money.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.920
Whether
it's 50 cents or 5,000 dollars.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.660
That's the only way
your life will change.

01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.590
But still with this little bit
of money?

01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:17.100
Want to get some air?

01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:20.130
See if this money can actually
change anything.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.470
(Tteokbokki: 2 dollars)

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.720
Is it good?

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.090
Yes.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.360
You know, this is definitely...

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.860
Eating this actually does make me
feel better.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.700
I guess I haven't hit rock bottom
after all.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.770
That's the power of money for you.
Got it?

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.440
Yes.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.610
- What are you doing?
- I'm full, trying to sober up.

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:11.150
I totally blew up at Da Hee.
What am I supposed to do now?

01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:17.760
Ouch. Why does my forehead hurt?

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.990
Did you do something stupid?

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.630
(Two hours earlier)

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.280
Gosh, you scared me!

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.580
I...

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.280
I just wanted to ask you something.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.250
That song from earlier...

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.220
How do you know that song?

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.120
What?

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.090
What song?

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.060
The one you were just singing
at the bar.

01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:54.490
How do you know it?

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.630
It's just a song I like.

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:01.930
Right, but how?
It's not a well-known song. So how?

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.610
I can like it if I want to.
Am I not allowed to like it?

01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:09.310
That's not what I meant,
it's just...

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:12.340
- You must have hipsteritis.
- Excuse me? What?

01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:16.220
Or is this by some artist only
you're supposed to know about?

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.720
If not that, then...

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.820
do you just think my taste in music
sucks?

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.250
No.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.120
So now you're going to critique
my taste in music, too?

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.360
- No, that's not it at all.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:32.330
Look.

01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:36.700
- What?
- Sorry, but can we do this later?

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.770
As you're probably aware,

01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:43.380
I've had a really rough day today.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.950
You can just try harder next time.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.320
I just want to know how on earth
you know that song...

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.190
Try harder?

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:00.660
Yes, try harder.

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:07.700
What's with your eyes?

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.770
Your eyes are a little...

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.370
unhinged.

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:16.010
You look unhinged.
Why are you getting closer?

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:19.180
Why are you coming closer?
Gosh, what's wrong?

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:22.650
I'm done trying harder!

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:54.310
(To the Moon)

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.040
How wasted was I last night?

01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:24.010
I didn't do anything stupid, did I?

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.150
Dr. Ham, what brings you here?

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:28.780
- Don't we have things to discuss?
- Ta-da!

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.220
- You're still insisting on Beijing?
- I just think something's off.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.290
- I hear he's been hard to reach.
- He's cheating, I'm telling you!

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.760
You've got to be kidding me.
You really made that much so fast?

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:39.860
- Put a bit more into crypto.
- I shouldn't do it.

01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:40.930
Oh, no, sir...

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:41.930
Well, no wonder.

01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:43.930
All that trouble
was over that measly bit of money.

01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:49.940
