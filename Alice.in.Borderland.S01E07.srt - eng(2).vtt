00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.228
There's a fire
at the back of the building!

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:29.237
We have to find whoever murdered Momoka
and burn them in the Fire of Judgement.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.614
A witch hunt game, huh?
This ought to be good.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.368
The game started.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.163
Rain check on our date?

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.625
All right, let's go witch hunting!

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.225
You, you're always with her.

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:01.519
Why weren't you with her today?

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.396
What?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.608
That's true, you weren't.
What happened? You fight?

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.486
- Are you our witch?
- It's not me!

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.446
I guess we'll know
when we throw you in the fire!

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:13.114
I was in my room! She was my friend!

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:16.076
So you're with her everyday,
except the day she gets killed.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.372
Great, then we're agreed,
she's the witch. Take her to the fire!

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.000
Come on, let's go!

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.044
- Let me go!
- Come on!

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.837
I didn't kill her!

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.174
- Let me go!
- That's enough!

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.426
Put down Asahi.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.804
We're all suspects in this game.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:42.769
Where were all of you?
And what were… were you all doing?

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:44.854
And can you prove it?

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:51.319
I can prove that you and I were having
a good time in bed.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.449
Everyone will take turns explaining
what you did in the past hour.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.201
Look, blood!

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:04.499
- I can explain this.
- Finally, this is getting interesting.

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:06.793
- I say she's the witch!
- You're wrong.

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:08.795
This is Hatter's blood.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:15.260
I was examining Hatter's body.
That's how the blood got on me.

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:16.386
His body?

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.099
Hatter was murdered.

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:25.520
- Hatter was killed?
- Why didn't you tell us?

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:28.857
The executives believed
that this might throw everyone

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.108
into a panic.

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:33.570
What else are you… you people hiding
from us? Huh? What?

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.364
- No more secrets, okay?
- Calm down.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.537
I took this bullet from Hatter's body.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.541
Its caliber is the same
as those we have here at the Beach.

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:47.667
Uh-huh?

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:52.922
This means that someone here
at the Beach killed Hatter.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:01.389
Do you think that maybe
the witch killed Hatter?

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.436
I mean, that doesn't sound so crazy,
am I right?

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.646
Uh, the witch could be one of them--

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.029
I found her annoying.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:18.281
Let's just burn everyone.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.455
If someone here is the witch,

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.834
then everyone in this room except me
could be the witch.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.924
So, who here is the witch? Step forward.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.265
If no one here will admit it,

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:46.935
then all of you will burn.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.105
Yahoo!

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.367
Woo-hoo!

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.660
Get up!

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.289
{\an8}1 PER PERSON

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.333
Come on!

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:14.545
Comb through all of them, got that?

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.964
No one escapes!

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.465
Are you really gonna do what he says?

00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:19.509
We worked together as a team until today.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.177
- Eh?
- If the game doesn't end

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.136
after you do this,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.138
then eventually, we'll have to kill--

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.556
Woo-hoo!

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:29.060
Burn him. He's of no use to us now.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.271
Let's go, guys!

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:50.850
Suzuka, hurry!

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:09.118
We have others to question
and time's running out.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.592
Listen, hide inside this room.

00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:26.677
Alone? I want to stay with you.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.763
I have to go and find someone.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.807
Let me come too, Usagi.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.142
It's sure to be game over for me
if I stay here.

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:37.105
It's me, Tatta!

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:41.234
Listen, hear me out.

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:43.903
I think we should work together
like we have before.

00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:49.826
Help me find Arisu.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.581
We gotta keep moving,
they're getting close.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:56.833
They're getting closer.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.126
Come on, hurry.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.300
Suzuka!

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:11.931
Don't shoot, she's not the witch! I swear!

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.645
Don't think, just shoot.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.898
Please…

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.860
Don't kill me.

00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:26.446
It's not me.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.157
Please!

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.950
Don't do it!

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:32.368
I have to

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.411
or I'm next.

00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:35.413
You're not human!

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.565
They've all gone crazy.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:48.903
Not their smartest move.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.781
Why would they go so far just to survive?

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:56.285
There's no way to find out
who the witch is this way.

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.875
You could be the witch. Right, Kuina?

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.213
Or it could be you.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.418
Herd them out through the courtyard.

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.588
It'll be easier to move their bodies.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.758
Some of them are hiding inside the hotel.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.095
But I'll force them all out.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:15.948
Arisu!

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.244
- Arisu!
- Arisu.

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:22.913
Arisu!

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.540
Arisu!

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.418
Arisu!

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.464
- Arisu!
- Arisu!

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:36.302
GASOLINE, KEROSENE

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.786
Asahi?

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.297
Are you okay?

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.967
I… I can't do this.

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:27.353
Have you seen Arisu?

00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:32.400
He's in the main building.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:38.656
- Arisu!
- Arisu!

00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:44.620
Come here you bastard!

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:00.386
Joe.

00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:04.181
Saiko, you bitch!

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.355
Where is Arisu?

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:14.692
He's somewhere on…

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.778
the fourth floor.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.114
How do you know that?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.658
I saw Niragi come out of a room there.

00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:52.062
- What do you want?
- Hey.

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.440
What are you doing?

00:12:54.523 --> 00:12:56.233
Come here and give me a hand.

00:12:56.984 --> 00:12:59.612
Are you the witch?

00:13:00.237 --> 00:13:01.781
Unfortunately, not.

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:04.408
What about you?

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:08.120
I'm guessing not.

00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:13.876
Anyone trying to find the witch
on their own is not one.

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:17.004
If you were the witch,
you'd be hiding right now

00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:18.881
or having fun killing people.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.801
Again, what are you doing?

00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:24.345
Looking for the witch.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.098
Ah, here it is.

00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:29.975
What's that?

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:32.394
Cyanoacrylate glue.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.355
It's a super glue.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:35.981
And?

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:40.444
And if we heat this up
and apply it on the murder weapon,

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:43.239
all the moisture
in the cyanoacrylate will evaporate

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:45.282
and hopefully, leave behind fingerprints.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.117
Fingerprints?

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:50.871
Then I'll be able to use cocoa powder

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:54.083
to dust for fingerprints
on the knife handle.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.418
After I lift the fingerprints
with cellophane tape,

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:58.003
I'll be able to identify the witch.

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.216
What did you do before you came here?

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:04.385
Forensics, Tokyo Metro Police.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.681
Pretty good.
We can clear the game with this.

00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:21.110
You, go ahead.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:22.903
What?

00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:26.991
We need you to help us to clear this game.

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.999
Run, come on!

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.007
Down there!

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.922
Run for the annex!

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:48.530
No!

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:58.916
Okay, aim!

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:01.001
Let's do this, come on!

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:04.171
Steady, aim…

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.967
Did you see that?

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.513
Hey! Stand up!
We're not done with you yet! Come on!

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:14.473
Get up!

00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:16.684
If you don't move, you can have lunch.

00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:21.814
Pissy rice soup!

00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:23.899
- Okay, whose turn is it?
- Mine! Mine!

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.694
Come on, stand up! Come on!

00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:29.613
On your feet, Niragi!

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:39.248
Don't you get tired
of bullying people weaker than you?

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:43.711
And where were you hiding?

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:47.089
Oh, there are lots of places
for me to hide.

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.926
You really get on my nerves,
you know that?

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.095
Think you're so goddamn smart.

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.597
Acting like you're so damn clever!

00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:59.226
I don't have to act clever.

00:17:03.313 --> 00:17:05.399
Okay then.

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.031
Why don't we put an end to this right now?

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.150
Whoa, pretty good.

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:13.110
What'd you do before you got here?

00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:16.321
I sold wedding gowns.

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.749
Never hesitate to strike.

00:20:50.582 --> 00:20:52.834
Not in my house!

00:20:55.128 --> 00:20:58.465
You're a boy! A boy, not a girl!

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.559
Hikari.

00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:12.521
Don't ever come back.

00:21:31.164 --> 00:21:33.417
Hikari? Hikari?

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:55.105
But enough about me.

00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:00.110
What about you?

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:08.952
Our main power supply's
been diverted since this game started.

00:22:09.036 --> 00:22:10.203
What?

00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:13.206
The electricity we've always used
from these power generators…

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.542
was switched to the hotel's power supply.

00:22:16.084 --> 00:22:19.463
That means that whoever's running the game

00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:21.048
snuck into the Beach

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:23.467
and controls its power from underground.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.511
What the hell are you saying?

00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:29.556
I think you know
who the witch is. That it's…

00:22:29.639 --> 00:22:31.099
someone close to you.

00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:33.602
You saying you think I'm the witch?

00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:35.395
Sorry, but you're wrong.

00:22:36.313 --> 00:22:38.648
Only the executive members
have information

00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:40.901
on how the power grid operates.

00:22:40.984 --> 00:22:45.989
I also know that only the executives have
the key to access the underground.

00:22:47.574 --> 00:22:50.869
And I'll kill all the executives
to get that key, starting with you.

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:55.624
Sorry, but I can't let you do that.
I've got plans.

00:22:55.707 --> 00:22:56.750
Uh-huh.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.045
Back off!

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:07.010
What the hell was that?

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:31.284
Robert Edwin Peary.

00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:34.955
{\an8}An explorer who devoted his entire life
to reaching the North Pole.

00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:36.164
THE BOUND UNIVERSE

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:38.125
{\an8}He failed to reach it several times.

00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:42.087
In fact, he lost eight of his toes
on one particular expedition.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.673
{\an8}However, in 1909, he became

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:47.342
{\an8}the first Westerner
to reach the North Pole.

00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:53.432
I'm leaving your dinner here.

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:03.275
As he marched ever forward
towards certain death,

00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:06.236
people often wondered
what drove him to do so.

00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:10.240
I believe,
that by facing the possibility of death,

00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:13.869
it was in fact,
his way to feel truly alive.

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:16.538
When will I, too, feel truly alive?

00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:17.664
Hey.

00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:22.627
What can… Mom do?

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.388
Even though I am alive,

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:37.350
I am in a place where I cannot even choose
what it is that I eat.

00:24:37.934 --> 00:24:41.021
I lived this life
without having any consciousness of death.

00:24:41.605 --> 00:24:44.441
How should I feel, then,
about truly living life?

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:50.780
I need to escape
from this temporary home I live in.

00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:55.202
I want to live in the real world.

00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:09.591
And then…

00:25:10.258 --> 00:25:12.385
I came to this land.

00:25:30.737 --> 00:25:34.282
Game cleared. Congratulations.

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:37.786
{\an8}GAME CLEARED
CONGRATULATIONS

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.002
This was the first time I felt it.

00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:48.547
The joy of life.

00:26:41.057 --> 00:26:42.350
I have heard…

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:45.812
I heard you were a tattooist
in the old world.

00:26:48.356 --> 00:26:49.232
Yeah.

00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:54.613
I want you to tattoo
something astounding on my body.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:01.244
So astounding that it won't be acceptable
in the old world.

00:27:09.502 --> 00:27:11.838
By doing this, I pledged to myself

00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:16.468
that I will live in this world forever.

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:26.770
My story…

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:30.774
…has no past.

00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.704
Oh, sorry, sorry.

00:27:45.413 --> 00:27:47.040
I understand it all now.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.586
I always thought
that you and I were the very same.

00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:53.922
Me and you?

00:27:57.926 --> 00:28:00.095
Both of us hate our past.

00:28:04.557 --> 00:28:07.310
But there's a very big difference
between us.

00:28:08.478 --> 00:28:11.189
You keep turning your back on your past.

00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:13.483
But I will face my past.

00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:16.861
And it will ensure that I survive.

00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:57.587
Do you remember that arcade that closed?

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.838
What was its name again?

00:29:58.922 --> 00:30:01.299
Uh, it was
in front of our high school, right?

00:30:01.382 --> 00:30:03.384
- What the hell was it again?
- Dream World.

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:06.054
You're right, Dream World!

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:08.389
That's it! It was Dream World.

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:13.895
I'd skip class to go there
and Arisu would already be there.

00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:16.481
Eyes glued to some dirty magazine,
reading it out loud.

00:30:17.232 --> 00:30:19.442
The porn magazines in the '90s were
the best.

00:30:19.526 --> 00:30:21.945
Yeah, they were really good.

00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:26.032
Actually, I liked reading the articles.
They were well-written.

00:30:27.575 --> 00:30:31.621
The day the arcade went bankrupt,
Arisu stood in front of the building

00:30:31.704 --> 00:30:33.706
- and cried.
- Yep, just me and the owner.

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:39.754
Ah, those days were the best.

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:42.841
Even though we bitched about it,
high school was awesome.

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:47.303
Arisu.

00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:51.766
Do something with your life.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.854
Yeah. And remember us.

00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:57.272
Promise, Arisu?

00:32:21.522 --> 00:32:22.649
Help me.

00:32:24.317 --> 00:32:25.401
I'm here.

00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:28.237
Someone!

00:32:31.532 --> 00:32:32.492
Smoke?

00:32:33.868 --> 00:32:36.287
Huh? Is there a fire?

00:32:38.164 --> 00:32:39.374
I hear someone.

00:32:47.382 --> 00:32:51.260
Help! Someone!

00:33:08.403 --> 00:33:09.862
Someone, help me!

00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:12.365
In here!

00:33:12.448 --> 00:33:14.158
Arisu!

00:33:14.242 --> 00:33:15.868
The door won't open!

00:33:43.229 --> 00:33:45.565
- I did that.
- I can't do this anymore.

00:34:00.997 --> 00:34:02.206
Arisu!

00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:04.751
Usagi.

00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:46.084
Is that all you've got? Hmm?

00:34:48.503 --> 00:34:50.171
I knew it when I saw you.

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:54.300
Your will to survive is weak.

00:34:56.427 --> 00:34:57.762
It's weak, is it?

00:34:58.930 --> 00:34:59.931
Really?

00:35:24.413 --> 00:35:25.456
Hikari?

00:35:40.888 --> 00:35:43.558
You look completely different.

00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:52.316
To me…

00:35:54.527 --> 00:35:57.446
you look beautiful.

00:36:22.638 --> 00:36:23.639
{\an8}Thank you.

00:37:29.538 --> 00:37:31.374
"Never hesitate to strike."

00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:34.460
I have done as you taught me,

00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:36.295
Father.

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:50.601
It's good to see you.

00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:53.437
- You're okay?
- Uh-huh, thank you.

00:37:55.898 --> 00:37:59.110
I hate to break this to you now,
but we only have 30 minutes left.

00:38:00.903 --> 00:38:03.531
Okay, explain the rules to me quickly.

00:38:11.914 --> 00:38:13.040
Out of ammo.

00:38:15.209 --> 00:38:19.088
We've killed a lot of them,
but we still haven't found the witch.

00:38:23.884 --> 00:38:25.594
What the hell are we doing?

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.308
This is the worst of the games yet.

00:38:31.225 --> 00:38:34.478
But just like those horse-headed taggers
we met before,

00:38:34.562 --> 00:38:38.316
they were forced to participate
with rules of their own.

00:38:39.066 --> 00:38:40.985
I'm sure it's the…

00:38:41.068 --> 00:38:42.903
…the same this time.

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:45.656
The witch had to kill that girl
to start the game

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.992
and try to survive until the end of it.

00:38:48.075 --> 00:38:49.994
In other words, the witch clears the game

00:38:50.077 --> 00:38:51.746
if everyone at the Beach gets a Game Over,

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:52.997
or gets killed by the laser.

00:38:53.581 --> 00:38:55.875
But who the hell could be the witch?

00:38:55.958 --> 00:38:57.710
If I were the witch,

00:38:58.502 --> 00:39:00.129
I'd join the others in the hunt.

00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:02.757
Because it'd be Game Over if I was caught.

00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:06.635
So, it's someone in the militant corps?

00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:09.472
Niragi, Last Boss, or Aguni, huh?

00:39:09.555 --> 00:39:11.432
No. If that was the case,

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:13.768
the militant corps would simply kill
each other.

00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:16.854
It doesn't feel like
that's the purpose of the game.

00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:18.981
The purpose of the game?

00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:20.858
This is a Hearts game.

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:23.944
It's not just a physical game.

00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:27.365
I know because I've cleared
a Hearts game before.

00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:29.825
It's the most evil of the games.

00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:31.786
You toy with people's feelings.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.956
You betray and try to kill each other.

00:39:36.582 --> 00:39:39.919
The Hearts game can eat away at your soul.

00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:45.674
Even if the militant corps wins,
other conflicts will turn up.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.844
So, what should we do?

00:39:51.931 --> 00:39:53.516
Something's not right.

00:39:55.351 --> 00:39:56.685
What could it be?

00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:02.233
If I was the witch,

00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:04.819
{\an8}how would I steer…

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:06.529
{\an8}the game to win?

00:40:55.411 --> 00:40:56.912
It doesn't suit you.

00:41:01.167 --> 00:41:03.586
Who would've thought
that the best men's club host in Kabukicho

00:41:03.669 --> 00:41:04.837
would wind up being a hatter?

00:41:06.172 --> 00:41:09.425
It was my father's dying wish.

00:41:10.217 --> 00:41:12.595
You were an SDF officer, weren't you?

00:41:14.263 --> 00:41:16.849
You could've done anything
but join the yakuza.

00:41:19.518 --> 00:41:20.686
Speaking of the yakuza,

00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:24.523
Shogo was killed
for skimming the government's payoff.

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:35.034
You know, you're the only old friend
that I've still got left.

00:41:36.452 --> 00:41:37.745
Live long, friend.

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:41.457
You too.

00:42:04.313 --> 00:42:05.314
{\an8}No.

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:11.070
I shouldn't be putting myself
in the witch's shoes.

00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:14.323
{\an8}I should be in the shoes
of the game master.

00:42:15.324 --> 00:42:16.367
Game master?

00:42:17.117 --> 00:42:18.035
Don't you see?

00:42:18.118 --> 00:42:21.872
The game was designed to suit
both its location and its players.

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:24.333
Right after Hatter was killed,

00:42:24.416 --> 00:42:25.918
Momoka was murdered.

00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:28.712
Someone who knows
the ins and outs of the Beach…

00:42:28.796 --> 00:42:30.923
constructed the game and its timing.

00:42:31.757 --> 00:42:33.676
They constructed the timing?

00:42:33.759 --> 00:42:36.804
The two deaths didn't happen
at the same time by chance.

00:42:38.681 --> 00:42:42.768
{\an8}It's like that that the game master
has been waiting for this moment.

00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:44.687
Seriously?

00:42:45.854 --> 00:42:47.815
Then, who's the witch?

00:42:49.483 --> 00:42:53.988
Hatter's death was announced
after Momoka died.

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:57.241
The only people who knew
of his death before that…

00:42:57.825 --> 00:43:00.494
were the militant corps
and the executives.

00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:06.834
But the game master may have known
about Hatter's death too.

00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:11.755
Then everyone at the Beach is a suspect.

00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:15.301
When I passed by the lobby
an hour before the game started,

00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:18.137
Momoka's body wasn't there.

00:43:19.847 --> 00:43:22.099
Someone must have moved her body there

00:43:22.182 --> 00:43:23.934
sometime during that hour.

00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:26.895
No point questioning someone.
The witch can simply lie.

00:43:26.979 --> 00:43:28.105
The question is…

00:43:30.649 --> 00:43:33.444
why did the game start when it did?

00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:37.114
Why did they wait for Hatter's death

00:43:37.698 --> 00:43:39.366
before starting the game?

00:43:40.826 --> 00:43:41.994
I'm guessing it was…

00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:45.414
to throw the Beach
into a state of confusion.

00:43:45.497 --> 00:43:46.707
If that's true…

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:50.878
If I were the game master,
what would I do next?

00:44:15.778 --> 00:44:17.071
But of course.

00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:20.282
I know who it is!

00:44:27.956 --> 00:44:30.542
If we stop here,
then all we did would be pointless.

00:44:30.626 --> 00:44:31.919
We can't stop now!

00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:44.556
Time remaining, 20 minutes.

00:44:58.612 --> 00:44:59.738
What is it?

00:45:03.992 --> 00:45:05.327
I think that I know…

00:45:07.621 --> 00:45:08.914
who the witch is.
