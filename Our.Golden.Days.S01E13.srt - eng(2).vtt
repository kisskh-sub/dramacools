00:00:01.328 --> 00:00:03.098
(Episode 13)

00:00:31.018 --> 00:00:32.028
What...

00:00:52.978 --> 00:00:53.978
Hold on.

00:00:54.848 --> 00:00:56.248
Why should I be the one hiding?

00:00:58.518 --> 00:00:59.518
That...

00:01:02.918 --> 00:01:04.758
Thank you for applying...

00:01:04.758 --> 00:01:07.158
for the After-School Care Teacher position.

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:12.568
We regret to inform you we have chosen other candidates.

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:13.768
Thank you.

00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:16.698
"Thank you" for what?

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:19.408
If you were so thankful, you'd have at least interviewed me.

00:01:22.378 --> 00:01:23.838
Once you're over 50,

00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:27.078
they won't even call you for a desk job interview.

00:01:27.978 --> 00:01:29.178
That's so unfair.

00:01:29.878 --> 00:01:31.148
Especially when they said age didn't matter.

00:01:34.488 --> 00:01:35.618
(Dalbaram Daycare: application unsuccessful)

00:01:35.688 --> 00:01:38.228
I know I'd be great with kids.

00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:46.868
Yes, hello?

00:01:51.168 --> 00:01:54.308
Hello. Is this Kim Da Jeong's phone?

00:01:55.608 --> 00:01:56.778
Honey?

00:01:57.208 --> 00:02:00.048
Yes. Are you in a good mood or something?

00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:02.318
A good mood? My foot.

00:02:03.418 --> 00:02:04.818
Why did you call?

00:02:05.418 --> 00:02:09.058
Oh, well... Don't you have something to tell me?

00:02:09.488 --> 00:02:11.158
What's gotten into you?

00:02:12.088 --> 00:02:13.728
No, it's nothing. Forget it. I'm hanging up.

00:02:17.128 --> 00:02:21.128
That kid. He's back in Seoul and didn't even call.

00:02:24.368 --> 00:02:25.968
- Hello. - Hi.

00:02:28.808 --> 00:02:30.908
Nice to meet you all. I'm Lee Ji Hyuk, CEO of Mamdaerozip.

00:02:32.408 --> 00:02:34.048
Yes, I'm Kang Dong Hoon. I handle back-end development.

00:02:34.048 --> 00:02:35.218
We spoke on the phone.

00:02:35.278 --> 00:02:38.248
- Yes. - This is Lee Jae Hyun, front-end,

00:02:39.018 --> 00:02:40.218
and our designer, Jung Yu Jin.

00:02:41.248 --> 00:02:42.288
I'm Lee Jae Hyun.

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:46.388
I heard you were like a bulldozer, so I was a bit nervous.

00:02:46.788 --> 00:02:49.358
I'm Jung Yu Jin. I'm the same age as Jae Hyun.

00:02:50.058 --> 00:02:54.068
Have you all reviewed the prototype one of my seniors put together?

00:02:54.368 --> 00:02:55.998
What were your first impressions?

00:02:56.138 --> 00:02:57.968
- Please, have a seat. - Yes.

00:02:59.268 --> 00:03:02.408
So the part-timer got into a car accident.

00:03:02.938 --> 00:03:05.248
Fortunately, it wasn't serious,

00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:07.208
but she is getting on in years.

00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:10.418
- I see. - You can start today, right?

00:03:10.478 --> 00:03:11.648
Yes, of course.

00:03:12.018 --> 00:03:14.088
All right, I'll show you how to use the POS system first.

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:15.788
- Please come this way. - Okay.

00:03:18.528 --> 00:03:21.328
- See you at the exhibition, then. - Okay.

00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:24.298
You've worked so hard. Get some rest for a few days.

00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:25.598
I will.

00:03:34.608 --> 00:03:36.708
Breaking news! Lee Ji Hyuk is back.

00:03:36.938 --> 00:03:38.178
What do you mean?

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:39.678
Ji Hyuk is here?

00:03:40.378 --> 00:03:42.148
It was foolish of me to stay in this chat.

00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:43.918
(Lee Ji Hyuk Wedding Planning Committee)

00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:47.618
(Leave chat)

00:03:47.688 --> 00:03:48.958
(Are you sure you want to leave? Cancel, Leave)

00:03:59.098 --> 00:04:02.168
- Mom, you're still up? - Hey, Eun Oh.

00:04:02.598 --> 00:04:05.038
You're home earlier than I expected.

00:04:06.168 --> 00:04:10.138
- You said you'd be up all night. - Yes, but I was so sleepy today.

00:04:10.578 --> 00:04:11.678
And hungry.

00:04:12.248 --> 00:04:13.248
Really?

00:04:13.948 --> 00:04:17.218
I cooked something for you for tomorrow morning.

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:20.318
I made some pumpkin porridge. Get changed and come eat.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:25.588
Pumpkin porridge. My favourite.

00:04:34.128 --> 00:04:37.568
She'll turn the house upside down again, looking for her phone.

00:04:39.508 --> 00:04:40.508
Mom.

00:04:41.068 --> 00:04:42.608
My birth mother wouldn't be like this.

00:04:45.008 --> 00:04:46.148
Gang Oh,

00:04:46.778 --> 00:04:47.878
I'm sorry.

00:05:02.728 --> 00:05:04.158
Here's your Americano.

00:05:04.158 --> 00:05:05.928
- Thanks. - Thank you!

00:05:05.998 --> 00:05:06.998
Hey.

00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:08.468
Hey, Eun Oh!

00:05:08.838 --> 00:05:09.868
Oh, hey...

00:05:10.098 --> 00:05:12.008
- Hey, come on. - Come on, quick.

00:05:14.638 --> 00:05:17.108
- So, Ji Hyuk's office is here. - Yes.

00:05:17.178 --> 00:05:19.408
- You said nothing about it? - Seriously, how could you?

00:05:19.478 --> 00:05:23.748
- Oh, you're waiting for Ji Hyuk? - Of course.

00:05:24.318 --> 00:05:25.518
- I'm here too. - Hi.

00:05:25.588 --> 00:05:26.648
- Hello. - Hey, it's been a while.

00:05:26.718 --> 00:05:27.718
- Hello. - How have you been?

00:05:29.818 --> 00:05:30.958
- Eun Oh, long time no see. - Hey.

00:05:31.588 --> 00:05:33.088
Hey, Eun Oh.

00:05:33.628 --> 00:05:34.758
Have a seat over here.

00:05:35.028 --> 00:05:38.228
If you don't spill the tea today, everyone will be disappointed.

00:05:38.828 --> 00:05:41.698
I have something urgent to take care of.

00:05:43.538 --> 00:05:44.538
- Hey, Eun Oh! - Hey.

00:05:44.598 --> 00:05:45.638
- Come on. Don't be like that. - Tell us.

00:05:45.638 --> 00:05:47.568
- Jun Sang! - Eun Oh is working.

00:05:47.768 --> 00:05:50.838
Jun Sang posted a surprise meetup. Didn't you see it?

00:05:51.038 --> 00:05:52.048
I deleted it.

00:05:52.608 --> 00:05:54.908
Tell the storage room guy not to come in today.

00:05:56.548 --> 00:05:57.548
Got it.

00:06:00.388 --> 00:06:04.558
My goal is to get the MVP on the App Store within a month.

00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:05.758
A month?

00:06:06.728 --> 00:06:07.988
Just a moment.

00:06:08.758 --> 00:06:10.558
A month? Then...

00:06:11.228 --> 00:06:15.198
The Hangyeol members are here, especially Jun Sang.

00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:16.298
They're drinking.

00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:20.638
Bad timing for them. Why did they have to come today?

00:06:21.208 --> 00:06:22.338
I won't be coming today.

00:06:22.538 --> 00:06:24.208
I'll be meeting with my developers all night.

00:06:26.648 --> 00:06:29.018
- Shall we get into the details? - Yes.

00:06:29.018 --> 00:06:31.818
I really want to make sure we make a coordinator sign-up menu.

00:06:33.548 --> 00:06:35.388
We'll need two painters, of course,

00:06:35.388 --> 00:06:37.458
and one stationery or home goods designer.

00:06:37.788 --> 00:06:39.728
What do you think about working with three artists in total?

00:06:44.098 --> 00:06:46.298
Because of the space for exhibiting and selling the art...

00:06:47.098 --> 00:06:49.238
What if it disrupts the artists' work?

00:06:50.238 --> 00:06:53.068
Eun Oh, Ji Hyuk isn't coming in today.

00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:54.368
He has an all-night development meeting.

00:06:57.078 --> 00:06:58.108
Lucky him.

00:07:00.778 --> 00:07:04.978
Ji Hyuk asked a high school friend to develop an app for him.

00:07:05.188 --> 00:07:08.418
That friend went to school with Mr. Lee from our team.

00:07:08.888 --> 00:07:11.828
I looked it up and found the website.

00:07:12.058 --> 00:07:14.528
Their office address is right here.

00:07:14.688 --> 00:07:16.458
Right here, Cafe Agit.

00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:19.368
If he's starting a business,

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.498
do you think he got settlement money from that girl?

00:07:24.538 --> 00:07:26.208
Don't you think that's going too far?

00:07:27.968 --> 00:07:29.308
Ji Hyuk isn't that kind of guy.

00:07:29.308 --> 00:07:32.848
Really? Then how did he manage to open an office here?

00:07:34.178 --> 00:07:38.948
I've known him since freshman year. I don't know about the money,

00:07:39.018 --> 00:07:40.948
but is he the type to celebrate that by opening an office here?

00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:42.488
No way.

00:07:43.318 --> 00:07:45.158
Ji Hyuk must've had his reasons.

00:07:45.688 --> 00:07:47.488
Hey, you.

00:07:48.288 --> 00:07:52.128
- Should we find out if that's true? - Be my guest.

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:54.898
- Fine. - Hey.

00:07:56.498 --> 00:07:59.068
Ji Eun Oh. You're coming with me.

00:07:59.168 --> 00:08:01.638
You need to get to the bottom of this.

00:08:02.108 --> 00:08:03.878
I'm in the middle of working right now.

00:08:04.778 --> 00:08:08.108
You and Ji Hyuk...

00:08:08.178 --> 00:08:10.018
There's something between you, isn't there?

00:08:12.118 --> 00:08:14.148
You're crossing a line.

00:08:16.588 --> 00:08:17.718
This little punk...

00:08:18.658 --> 00:08:20.988
- You can't come in here. - What class are you?

00:08:21.658 --> 00:08:24.228
Excuse me. This is a place of business.

00:08:24.758 --> 00:08:28.128
Just go calm her down and bring her over.

00:08:28.228 --> 00:08:30.898
We're all dying to know, so we're not going home.

00:08:31.098 --> 00:08:35.778
- If we wait all night, she'll come. - That's not the point. Go get her.

00:08:35.838 --> 00:08:37.778
- Darn it, seriously... - Let's go.

00:08:37.838 --> 00:08:39.308
Unbelievable.

00:08:45.118 --> 00:08:47.418
Su Jeong, I'm going to step out for a bit.

00:08:47.788 --> 00:08:48.788
Okay.

00:08:59.168 --> 00:09:02.568
Ji Eun Oh. Whose child are you to be this shameless?

00:09:03.638 --> 00:09:05.608
Give me back the money...

00:09:06.308 --> 00:09:07.338
my dad spent on you.

00:09:09.978 --> 00:09:11.638
I can't live under the same roof as her.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.848
So, choose. Is it me or Ji Eun Oh?

00:09:24.058 --> 00:09:28.058
You with your head down. What's got you so gloomy over here?

00:09:28.128 --> 00:09:29.958
Come on. It's obvious.

00:09:30.158 --> 00:09:31.628
You can tell she's bored just by looking.

00:09:31.628 --> 00:09:33.368
- Right. - Excuse me.

00:09:33.568 --> 00:09:35.638
- Want to join us for a drink? - No, thanks.

00:09:35.698 --> 00:09:38.398
- Give me one. - It's a little tight in here.

00:09:38.468 --> 00:09:41.108
- Then sit on the ground. - Why, you...

00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:43.038
- Come on, just... - Hey, now.

00:09:43.108 --> 00:09:45.948
- Let's go. We can drink over there. - What do you think you're doing?

00:09:46.408 --> 00:09:47.408
Let go of me!

00:09:47.478 --> 00:09:49.718
Let's have some fun. Don't be so difficult. Let's go!

00:09:49.778 --> 00:09:51.678
- Let go. I said, let go of me! - Come on.

00:09:51.678 --> 00:09:53.718
- Let go! - What's going on?

00:09:56.318 --> 00:09:57.418
And who are you?

00:09:58.758 --> 00:10:00.188
I'm her dad. You got a problem with that?

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:04.728
Dad?

00:10:05.598 --> 00:10:07.768
What are you doing out here at this time of night?

00:10:08.638 --> 00:10:09.898
And who are these punks?

00:10:10.138 --> 00:10:11.198
Who are you guys?

00:10:16.538 --> 00:10:17.538
Good grief.

00:10:20.648 --> 00:10:22.018
Are you okay?

00:11:00.988 --> 00:11:03.488
Mister, why are you still standing there?

00:11:04.688 --> 00:11:05.928
I was waiting for you.

00:11:07.128 --> 00:11:08.128
You were?

00:11:09.558 --> 00:11:11.798
Until you were done crying.

00:11:13.668 --> 00:11:16.798
Mister, why do you keep talking like you're my dad?

00:11:17.038 --> 00:11:19.238
You don't even know me.

00:11:35.588 --> 00:11:38.888
I have to catch my bus on this side. How about you?

00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.128
- Mine is that way. - I see.

00:11:42.198 --> 00:11:43.358
Thank you for your help.

00:11:44.328 --> 00:11:46.298
Of course. Get home safe.

00:12:03.518 --> 00:12:06.518
She seemed so innocent and bright.

00:12:10.058 --> 00:12:11.958
I wonder what sadness she's carrying.

00:12:14.528 --> 00:12:15.558
Oh, well.

00:12:21.298 --> 00:12:22.638
Look at the time.

00:12:26.108 --> 00:12:28.408
Eun Oh, I'm closing up and heading out.

00:12:28.708 --> 00:12:29.908
I left the cash over there.

00:12:31.778 --> 00:12:33.248
(Wallpapering: Day 2)

00:12:33.308 --> 00:12:35.178
(1. Lining paper, surface prep, 2. checking wall flatness)

00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.888
Hey, Mom. I might have to pull an all-nighter.

00:12:48.258 --> 00:12:49.458
Don't wait up.

00:12:58.138 --> 00:13:00.138
(Bathroom, move to the living room)

00:13:03.638 --> 00:13:04.678
All done.

00:13:10.178 --> 00:13:12.188
(Cafe Agit)

00:13:16.218 --> 00:13:17.858
I can't live under the same roof as her.

00:13:19.388 --> 00:13:22.058
So, choose. Is it me or Ji Eun Oh?

00:13:22.998 --> 00:13:24.058
It's Eun Oh.

00:13:25.198 --> 00:13:26.198
My daughter.

00:13:28.898 --> 00:13:32.538
Tell Mom she won't see me again until things are back to normal.

00:13:32.538 --> 00:13:35.778
- Mom, you're still up? - Hey, Eun Oh.

00:13:42.248 --> 00:13:44.548
(Cafe Agit)

00:14:09.108 --> 00:14:11.908
Eun Oh, Ji Hyuk isn't coming in today.

00:14:11.978 --> 00:14:13.448
He has an all-night development meeting.

00:14:16.118 --> 00:14:17.718
I thought he said he wasn't sleeping here.

00:16:12.528 --> 00:16:13.668
Who's there?

00:16:14.468 --> 00:16:15.768
Who the heck are you?

00:16:32.988 --> 00:16:33.988
Ji Eun Oh.

00:16:34.288 --> 00:16:35.288
Ji Eun Oh!

00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:40.058
My gosh...

00:16:40.628 --> 00:16:44.328
- Ji Eun Oh. - Here... I'm over here.

00:16:51.698 --> 00:16:53.538
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

00:16:58.278 --> 00:16:59.308
I'm okay.

00:16:59.878 --> 00:17:01.848
You got here just in time.

00:17:09.388 --> 00:17:10.558
Are you stupid?

00:17:11.288 --> 00:17:12.288
Can't you think straight?

00:17:12.858 --> 00:17:15.628
Why stand there as a creep broke in? You should have run!

00:17:16.398 --> 00:17:18.098
I thought it was you.

00:17:18.658 --> 00:17:22.128
I thought you'd lost your key and were coming in through the back.

00:17:24.638 --> 00:17:25.638
So that's what you thought.

00:17:28.238 --> 00:17:30.478
Anyway, thank you.

00:17:36.318 --> 00:17:37.448
You're leaving now?

00:17:38.648 --> 00:17:40.218
Of course. I should get going.

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:42.048
Choose.

00:17:42.348 --> 00:17:45.158
Go with the police, or come with me. I'm not letting you go home alone.

00:17:48.758 --> 00:17:51.458
I thought you still had your meeting.

00:17:52.928 --> 00:17:55.428
Thank goodness that meeting ended early.

00:19:44.078 --> 00:19:46.208
(Solnae Mansion)

00:20:01.788 --> 00:20:03.728
She really gets to me, in more ways than one.

00:20:49.338 --> 00:20:50.378
(My son, Gang Oh)

00:20:50.438 --> 00:20:51.938
(My birth mother wouldn't be like this.)

00:21:34.118 --> 00:21:35.888
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

00:21:36.858 --> 00:21:40.058
Why open a new one? Some are open. You think you own this place?

00:21:40.328 --> 00:21:41.758
Hey, I told you.

00:21:41.758 --> 00:21:43.328
My mom's bringing the money in about a week.

00:21:43.658 --> 00:21:45.258
Come on, man. It's just one beer.

00:21:46.098 --> 00:21:47.098
Why, you little...

00:22:10.118 --> 00:22:11.118
(I thought I could make it...)

00:22:16.858 --> 00:22:18.558
So, how much longer do you need me?

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:23.098
Just for another week.

00:22:24.198 --> 00:22:25.368
The shorter, the better.

00:22:27.238 --> 00:22:28.238
Okay.

00:22:45.388 --> 00:22:46.558
Hold on.

00:22:52.098 --> 00:22:53.098
This looks suspicious.

00:22:53.768 --> 00:22:55.398
Do you want to take this inside? Or...

00:22:55.828 --> 00:22:56.968
Should we check it out together?

00:23:04.138 --> 00:23:05.808
There's no one here right now.

00:23:10.318 --> 00:23:12.348
Isn't it supposed to be empty?

00:23:24.498 --> 00:23:26.468
It doesn't look like a bomb.

00:23:27.568 --> 00:23:29.198
You want to open it?

00:23:33.708 --> 00:23:35.208
It's probably nothing.

00:24:06.638 --> 00:24:08.208
To celebrate our 500th day,

00:24:08.538 --> 00:24:10.178
to my beloved Yeong Ra.

00:24:10.478 --> 00:24:12.578
This psycho...

00:24:21.988 --> 00:24:24.518
At this point, it's clear the guy is a total psycho.

00:24:25.258 --> 00:24:27.928
Seriously, what are the police even doing?

00:24:28.728 --> 00:24:30.028
I already told you.

00:24:30.298 --> 00:24:31.398
They said the CCTV...

00:24:31.728 --> 00:24:35.928
showed him entering near the school, and then he just vanished.

00:24:36.668 --> 00:24:39.638
And while he was taking all these pictures,

00:24:39.638 --> 00:24:40.908
what was the driver doing?

00:24:41.868 --> 00:24:45.178
He drove me safely and took good care of me.

00:24:45.908 --> 00:24:46.908
What?

00:24:47.208 --> 00:24:49.348
If he was keeping you so safe, how did this happen?

00:24:50.318 --> 00:24:51.448
Yeong Ra.

00:24:51.878 --> 00:24:54.988
Have you noticed anything strange lately?

00:24:56.718 --> 00:24:57.888
Not at all.

00:24:59.858 --> 00:25:04.198
Mom, I don't want a new driver. I'm scared of strangers.

00:25:05.398 --> 00:25:09.128
He's Seong Jae's friend's brother. I feel safest with him.

00:25:09.638 --> 00:25:11.298
I don't want to change drivers.

00:25:12.768 --> 00:25:15.468
- Yeong Ra. - What are you talking about?

00:25:15.868 --> 00:25:17.278
You were going to replace the driver?

00:25:17.738 --> 00:25:20.278
He was only helping us from the start...

00:25:20.278 --> 00:25:21.878
until we could find a permanent one.

00:25:22.108 --> 00:25:24.078
He has his own career to consider.

00:25:24.078 --> 00:25:26.418
We can't expect him to keep helping us.

00:25:28.888 --> 00:25:30.218
Can't we just ask him?

00:25:31.618 --> 00:25:33.328
We'll drop everything and beg him if we have to.

00:25:34.858 --> 00:25:38.398
Until we find out if this creep is a sociopath or a psychopath,

00:25:38.658 --> 00:25:41.228
we're not bringing anyone new in. Who can we trust?

00:25:44.368 --> 00:25:46.938
All right. You're right.

00:25:47.868 --> 00:25:52.678
Honey, go meet the police chief. In person.

00:25:52.808 --> 00:25:54.808
Take this with you, okay?

00:25:55.408 --> 00:25:58.218
(Shoealls)

00:26:01.218 --> 00:26:03.688
- Enjoy your new shoes. - Thank you.

00:26:03.758 --> 00:26:05.688
The right one. The right one, please.

00:26:14.468 --> 00:26:15.668
Here, let me.

00:26:16.228 --> 00:26:17.568
How's the size?

00:26:19.838 --> 00:26:21.908
- Excuse me? - Yes?

00:26:23.178 --> 00:26:24.578
It's for me.

00:26:24.978 --> 00:26:26.378
So could you show me a few pairs?

00:26:29.508 --> 00:26:31.418
This is our most popular model.

00:26:33.848 --> 00:26:37.658
Director, is everything okay? Why haven't you been by lately?

00:26:37.718 --> 00:26:40.988
Things have been hectic at work. How's Eun Oh doing?

00:26:41.588 --> 00:26:43.398
Did she get things sorted out with her brother?

00:26:44.928 --> 00:26:48.798
Gang Oh came back, but nothing's been resolved.

00:26:52.138 --> 00:26:54.768
That must be tough for Eun Oh.

00:26:55.038 --> 00:26:56.408
And she still has to deal with the construction.

00:26:56.508 --> 00:26:59.908
She's at the cafe today. Construction is off for three days.

00:27:11.718 --> 00:27:13.558
Hey, did you get any sleep?

00:27:15.858 --> 00:27:17.028
Have you eaten?

00:27:18.258 --> 00:27:19.968
Thank you for yesterday.

00:27:21.498 --> 00:27:22.928
I filed a report this morning.

00:27:23.468 --> 00:27:25.098
Be careful until they catch him.

00:27:25.798 --> 00:27:27.438
Make sure you warn Su Jeong, too.

00:27:35.608 --> 00:27:36.718
Warn her?

00:27:42.248 --> 00:27:44.888
Ji Hyuk's so thoughtful, isn't he?

00:27:44.888 --> 00:27:46.758
He handled the police matter himself.

00:27:46.828 --> 00:27:50.458
He even took the time to warn us while pulling all-nighters.

00:27:50.858 --> 00:27:53.398
He's always had a thoughtful side to him.

00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:56.938
Look at you, giving him credit for once.

00:27:57.868 --> 00:28:00.508
I do owe him big-time for yesterday.

00:28:01.708 --> 00:28:04.808
Oh, right! You can finally buy that used car.

00:28:06.038 --> 00:28:07.548
About that...

00:28:20.828 --> 00:28:22.428
Why? You didn't take the money?

00:28:23.028 --> 00:28:25.228
You took that job for the 20,000 dollars...

00:28:25.228 --> 00:28:27.068
since you gave Gang Oh the car money.

00:28:27.468 --> 00:28:29.198
I didn't take it because of Gang Oh.

00:28:29.598 --> 00:28:31.238
I figured it would be better if I were broke.

00:28:33.138 --> 00:28:34.838
If I took the 20,000 dollars,

00:28:35.238 --> 00:28:36.978
I knew I would've just given it to Gang Oh.

00:28:37.708 --> 00:28:39.108
But if I gave him that money,

00:28:40.308 --> 00:28:42.948
I was afraid it'd be like admitting I'm not really his sister.

00:28:43.078 --> 00:28:45.448
You should've just taken it and bought the car.

00:28:45.818 --> 00:28:47.818
That guy would send you a bill for raising him.

00:28:48.348 --> 00:28:50.518
It's not just because of Gang Oh.

00:28:51.018 --> 00:28:53.788
I realised how passionate Ji Hyuk is about his work.

00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:57.658
So, how could I take more than the usual fee from him?

00:29:00.128 --> 00:29:04.268
I guess you're right. Knowing you, your conscience wouldn't let you.

00:29:07.338 --> 00:29:09.668
Let's go back in. We've been gone too long.

00:29:10.108 --> 00:29:12.538
Anyway, be careful walking home at night.

00:29:18.518 --> 00:29:20.288
Hey, what's that smell?

00:30:18.008 --> 00:30:19.538
So, you haven't had lunch yet.

00:30:19.978 --> 00:30:22.278
I haven't eaten either. Let's go grab a bite together.

00:30:22.878 --> 00:30:25.078
It's not that I couldn't eat. I chose not to.

00:30:26.218 --> 00:30:28.448
That fool. She should just go with him.

00:30:28.988 --> 00:30:30.718
Seong Jae would treat her to something nice.

00:30:34.658 --> 00:30:37.728
Then let's make good on that movie promise.

00:30:39.198 --> 00:30:40.798
A movie promise?

00:30:42.368 --> 00:30:43.498
A movie?

00:30:45.098 --> 00:30:46.338
Eun Oh.

00:30:47.168 --> 00:30:49.338
I need you to watch a movie with me.

00:30:49.338 --> 00:30:51.538
You asked me to tell you when Ji Hyuk broke up...

00:30:52.838 --> 00:30:54.248
with his latest girlfriend.

00:30:56.078 --> 00:30:57.448
They broke up?

00:30:58.178 --> 00:30:59.778
Oh, right.

00:31:00.548 --> 00:31:03.988
I know it's been a while, but a promise is a promise.

00:31:05.158 --> 00:31:07.388
Of course. When would be a good time?

00:31:07.558 --> 00:31:10.928
But I have to work at the cafe on weekends.

00:31:12.598 --> 00:31:15.668
How about the day after tomorrow? It's your day off, no construction.

00:31:15.968 --> 00:31:19.868
- What about work? - I'll just take a personal day.

00:31:20.268 --> 00:31:22.338
So, I'll see you on Wednesday, then?

00:31:30.048 --> 00:31:32.748
- Hey, you. - Mr. Lee!

00:31:33.788 --> 00:31:35.118
Hello.

00:31:35.188 --> 00:31:36.218
- Hello. - I'm glad you could make it.

00:31:36.218 --> 00:31:38.058
- Min Woo, can you take this? - Sure.

00:31:38.358 --> 00:31:40.588
- Please have a seat over there. - Sure.

00:31:47.398 --> 00:31:49.368
The Contract Delegation Agreements, Powers of Attorney,

00:31:49.428 --> 00:31:50.438
the DIY Floor Plans,

00:31:50.438 --> 00:31:53.068
and the Schedule Coordination Agreements.

00:31:54.268 --> 00:31:57.938
Here are the 1st and 2nd drafts of the construction schedules.

00:31:58.108 --> 00:32:02.378
And the file on fixed-schedule units and the installation-ready units?

00:32:02.448 --> 00:32:04.478
- It's in the next section. - Okay.

00:32:04.778 --> 00:32:07.848
But five of the households can't set their schedules yet.

00:32:08.188 --> 00:32:11.458
They are working parents with kids, and they'd have to move twice.

00:32:12.088 --> 00:32:14.888
Right, the homes are occupied. What about the others?

00:32:15.188 --> 00:32:18.658
Most are using storage units and staying with family, at hotels,

00:32:18.728 --> 00:32:20.528
or short-term rentals. It's a real mix.

00:32:22.398 --> 00:32:24.238
Excuse me, where can I find Eunoism Design?

00:32:24.538 --> 00:32:26.098
I'm here to see Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

00:32:26.538 --> 00:32:29.668
Hello, I'm Ji Eun Oh. Please, come this way.

00:32:31.238 --> 00:32:32.338
A new client?

00:32:33.948 --> 00:32:36.308
I also own a six-story building.

00:32:36.918 --> 00:32:39.018
It needs some work done,

00:32:39.018 --> 00:32:41.618
so let's roll this fee into that job.

00:32:43.688 --> 00:32:44.688
Excuse me?

00:32:44.758 --> 00:32:46.418
(Summary of residents' requested construction schedules)

00:32:46.958 --> 00:32:49.128
The preferred dates are all bunched together.

00:32:49.428 --> 00:32:51.098
The construction costs will be significant,

00:32:51.358 --> 00:32:54.098
so even a seven-percent profit will be a huge amount.

00:32:56.228 --> 00:33:00.668
Ma'am, your home is a large villa, and you're asking for major changes.

00:33:00.768 --> 00:33:05.278
Also, you want to join two rooms and move a bathroom.

00:33:05.838 --> 00:33:08.248
That means completely changing the house's interior layout,

00:33:08.378 --> 00:33:10.848
so in a case like this, we have to charge a design fee.

00:33:10.948 --> 00:33:12.948
My daughter's going to live in the duplex.

00:33:13.048 --> 00:33:16.088
I'm only here because she told me how much she loves your designs.

00:33:16.248 --> 00:33:20.358
Besides, I promised more projects once my commercial tenant moves out.

00:33:24.298 --> 00:33:27.628
No. I don't think that's necessary.

00:33:28.868 --> 00:33:31.168
- I'm sorry? - You should find another firm.

00:33:31.938 --> 00:33:34.538
Oh, my. Look how greedy this young woman is.

00:33:34.738 --> 00:33:35.738
Listen here.

00:33:37.108 --> 00:33:41.708
I just want to be paid fairly. If you want a free renovation,

00:33:41.778 --> 00:33:45.448
you should do it yourself. Don't be so disrespectful.

00:33:46.048 --> 00:33:48.118
My parents didn't raise me to be treated this way.

00:33:48.748 --> 00:33:49.988
Now, please leave.

00:33:51.818 --> 00:33:54.928
You have some nerve, working in a cafe.

00:33:54.928 --> 00:33:56.558
You think making money is so easy?

00:34:13.748 --> 00:34:14.748
(Park Gyeong Hui)

00:34:17.448 --> 00:34:18.448
Oh, Gyeong Hui.

00:34:19.578 --> 00:34:22.288
I don't think I can make it. Especially not today...

00:34:24.918 --> 00:34:26.018
Woo Jin?

00:34:26.588 --> 00:34:27.858
Woo Jin's here?

00:34:28.788 --> 00:34:31.298
Are you serious? Why didn't Woo Jin call me?

00:34:31.528 --> 00:34:32.958
To surprise you.

00:34:34.598 --> 00:34:37.538
If it's for Woo Jin, I have to go. It's been forever.

00:34:43.738 --> 00:34:46.078
Here are your files, sir.

00:34:46.138 --> 00:34:47.148
Thank you. Good work.

00:34:47.548 --> 00:34:48.648
Oh, and Ms. Kim.

00:34:48.978 --> 00:34:52.678
First thing tomorrow morning, have every shoe we ever made...

00:34:52.748 --> 00:34:55.448
- sent up to my office. - Yes, sir.

00:35:06.928 --> 00:35:11.238

(Shoealls)

(Gaon Foundation)

00:35:30.358 --> 00:35:33.118
What could possibly be so important that you'd drag me from my house?

00:35:33.558 --> 00:35:35.158
Something serious has happened to Ji Eun Oh.

00:35:36.658 --> 00:35:38.328
It seems her brother found out she was adopted.

00:35:41.668 --> 00:35:42.668
And?

00:35:44.238 --> 00:35:48.908
Her brother ran away from home. He had a very negative reaction.

00:35:49.108 --> 00:35:51.738
He refuses to accept that she's not his biological sister.

00:35:53.238 --> 00:35:54.708
He refuses to accept it.

00:35:56.178 --> 00:35:57.318
Their house must be a complete wreck.

00:35:58.478 --> 00:36:02.318
And I've also observed that there are two men around Ji Eun Oh.

00:36:04.618 --> 00:36:06.058
She's dating both of them?

00:36:06.258 --> 00:36:08.588
No, neither of them is her boyfriend.

00:36:09.288 --> 00:36:11.998
Why are you telling me about men she isn't even dating?

00:36:12.428 --> 00:36:15.968
I have no interest in her love life unless it's serious.

00:36:16.768 --> 00:36:18.168
My apologies. It slipped my mind.

00:36:19.668 --> 00:36:23.438
Don't go overboard. I can see right through it.

00:36:24.508 --> 00:36:26.708
Just find out what I want to know.

00:36:27.048 --> 00:36:28.708
Exactly and in minute detail.

00:36:29.108 --> 00:36:30.108
Understood.

00:36:31.048 --> 00:36:32.048
Go on.

00:36:32.978 --> 00:36:35.048
The mother and daughter's reactions, their condition, the situation.

00:36:35.488 --> 00:36:38.118
- Cheers! - Cheers!

00:36:41.088 --> 00:36:42.628
How can our tastes be so incredibly different?

00:36:43.598 --> 00:36:46.598
Even our drinks are different. Soju, beer, somaek, wine.

00:36:46.698 --> 00:36:48.328
Plus, we have Min Seong, who doesn't even drink.

00:36:48.868 --> 00:36:53.268
Without that history project, we never would've become friends.

00:36:53.498 --> 00:36:56.538
We sat in different areas, different classes, different clubs.

00:36:56.668 --> 00:37:00.108
And different tastes. Except for you and me, Woo Jin?

00:37:01.548 --> 00:37:05.018
Thanks to our history teacher and that historic house project...

00:37:05.548 --> 00:37:06.988
And to Ji Eun Oh.

00:37:11.918 --> 00:37:13.758
- Do we really have to do this? - Come on, guys.

00:37:14.928 --> 00:37:16.188
Hand it over, or do you want a beating?

00:37:17.058 --> 00:37:19.198
- Let's just go. - No, you can't have this.

00:37:19.258 --> 00:37:20.268
This thing is worthless.

00:37:20.928 --> 00:37:23.228
- It was my dad's. - Hey, fine. Whatever.

00:37:23.328 --> 00:37:25.338
- Please give it back. - He said it was his dad's.

00:37:26.168 --> 00:37:27.708
- Those guys are well-known bullies. - Please...

00:37:27.968 --> 00:37:30.278
- There are 5 of us and 2 of them. - Give it back, please.

00:37:30.278 --> 00:37:32.808
- Eun Oh, what are you getting at? - Please...

00:37:35.578 --> 00:37:37.878
- Oh, no. There she goes again. - She shouldn't get involved.

00:37:37.948 --> 00:37:38.948
Hey!

00:37:43.888 --> 00:37:46.588
- Hey, run for it! Go! - Guys! Hey, guys!

00:37:46.718 --> 00:37:47.728
Forget it, just run!

00:37:48.258 --> 00:37:50.188
Go. Run!

00:37:54.968 --> 00:37:56.128
Go!

00:37:57.168 --> 00:38:00.268
- Man, I felt like I was in a movie. - Me too.

00:38:00.438 --> 00:38:04.738
Easy for you. It's a fond memory. I'm the one whose hair got chopped.

00:38:04.838 --> 00:38:05.838
My gosh.

00:38:13.688 --> 00:38:15.018
- Pigtails. - Yes.

00:38:16.248 --> 00:38:17.988
How did they find out we go to this school?

00:38:18.558 --> 00:38:19.958
We weren't even in our uniforms.

00:38:20.588 --> 00:38:23.928
Apparently, one of them remembered Yeong In's long, curly braids...

00:38:23.998 --> 00:38:25.798
and her red glasses.

00:38:26.858 --> 00:38:29.498
Apparently, that jerk's ex used to go to our school.

00:38:31.568 --> 00:38:32.568
Guys.

00:38:33.768 --> 00:38:34.768
What do I do?

00:38:37.708 --> 00:38:38.708
Yeong In.

00:38:39.338 --> 00:38:41.648
You've had the same hairstyle since elementary school, right?

00:38:42.278 --> 00:38:44.048
This is the perfect chance to change up your look.

00:38:44.518 --> 00:38:45.678
It's going to look so cute.

00:39:06.238 --> 00:39:07.238
Nice acting.

00:39:08.508 --> 00:39:09.608
- Hurry. - Oh, there they are.

00:39:13.178 --> 00:39:15.878
Yeong In saved us with her haircut.

00:39:15.878 --> 00:39:17.118
Totally. I'll give her that.

00:39:17.218 --> 00:39:20.218
That's right. That was me, wasn't it?

00:39:20.848 --> 00:39:22.018
My gosh.

00:39:22.688 --> 00:39:23.688
Hey.

00:39:23.988 --> 00:39:28.558
Yeong In's married, so let's ask. I've been dying to know.

00:39:29.388 --> 00:39:30.398
Woo Jin.

00:39:31.058 --> 00:39:33.458
Did you really break up with Yeong In because of Eun Oh?

00:39:34.868 --> 00:39:35.868
That's what I've been saying.

00:39:36.628 --> 00:39:39.368
- That's not what happened. - What are you talking about?

00:39:39.438 --> 00:39:44.238
My gosh. Seriously, Woo Jin, you were nicer to Eun Oh than me.

00:39:44.308 --> 00:39:46.178
And as for you, Eun Oh...

00:39:46.438 --> 00:39:49.908
You gave Woo Jin your bananas because you knew he liked them.

00:39:50.078 --> 00:39:52.478
Hey, Park Yeong In, after he broke up with you,

00:39:52.618 --> 00:39:55.118
do you have any idea how much he cried in front of me?

00:39:57.088 --> 00:39:59.388
- Really? - Yes, he really did.

00:39:59.488 --> 00:40:03.228
I told you we just clicked, but you refused to believe me.

00:40:03.628 --> 00:40:07.768
Wait. So you're saying I was just caught up in my own jealousy...

00:40:08.198 --> 00:40:09.568
and broke up with Woo Jin over nothing?

00:40:09.868 --> 00:40:10.868
Basically.

00:40:10.938 --> 00:40:13.908
Okay. The air is cleared, so let's make a toast.

00:40:13.968 --> 00:40:15.408
That's right, drink up. It's too late for regrets.

00:40:15.508 --> 00:40:18.778
- No, wait. Let me have my regrets! - Cheers!

00:40:27.788 --> 00:40:30.388
Hey, this is the women's restroom.

00:40:31.818 --> 00:40:33.188
I was waiting for you.

00:40:34.888 --> 00:40:35.888
Why?

00:40:39.028 --> 00:40:40.028
Ji Eun Oh.

00:40:41.328 --> 00:40:42.328
What's wrong?

00:40:44.668 --> 00:40:45.668
What?

00:40:47.738 --> 00:40:48.738
Eun Oh.

00:40:54.408 --> 00:40:55.508
Okay.

00:40:56.708 --> 00:40:59.318
I knew this would happen if I saw you.

00:41:10.188 --> 00:41:11.698
That feels better.

00:41:12.928 --> 00:41:14.398
I feel so much better after a good cry.

00:41:15.298 --> 00:41:16.398
Okay, so tell me what's wrong.

00:41:18.998 --> 00:41:21.368
Did you get rejected by that guy you liked?

00:41:24.308 --> 00:41:25.378
That guy...

00:41:27.108 --> 00:41:28.778
I confessed. And I got rejected.

00:41:30.678 --> 00:41:31.948
Well, Woo Jin...

00:41:32.848 --> 00:41:35.888
I guess my rose-coloured glasses were basically blackout curtains.

00:41:36.948 --> 00:41:38.188
Anyway...

00:41:38.258 --> 00:41:41.988
after a panorama of hate, contempt, and disappointment,

00:41:42.388 --> 00:41:46.158
- I cut him out of my life for good. - You clearly haven't.

00:41:46.828 --> 00:41:49.498
I knew something was wrong with you the second I saw you.

00:41:51.938 --> 00:41:53.338
It's not about him.

00:41:56.768 --> 00:41:58.178
Is it a family thing?

00:41:59.038 --> 00:42:01.548
It's unlike you to get this torn up over anything but guys or family.

00:42:03.808 --> 00:42:05.248
My mom's healthy.

00:42:06.178 --> 00:42:07.288
My brother is healthy too.

00:42:11.118 --> 00:42:12.618
So you're keeping a secret from me, aren't you?

00:42:15.888 --> 00:42:20.198
It wasn't really a secret. It just never came up.

00:42:22.828 --> 00:42:23.828
And now?

00:42:30.368 --> 00:42:31.608
Right.

00:42:32.408 --> 00:42:35.278
You always shake things off in a month, tops.

00:42:36.578 --> 00:42:38.078
You always spring right back.

00:42:39.678 --> 00:42:42.818
Oh, right. That was my nickname, "The Spring."

00:42:42.948 --> 00:42:45.758
- Because I was so bubbly. - You always were. Always.

00:42:46.088 --> 00:42:48.228
I bet you still are. You wouldn't change in one year.

00:42:48.728 --> 00:42:49.828
True.

00:42:50.558 --> 00:42:53.758
I am who I am. If I changed, I wouldn't be me.

00:42:54.468 --> 00:42:55.568
But...

00:42:56.998 --> 00:42:59.338
you just love your family so much.

00:43:00.538 --> 00:43:02.208
Crying about family at your age?

00:43:05.008 --> 00:43:06.838
That's because I was loved so much.

00:43:08.578 --> 00:43:09.678
I know you were.

00:43:10.278 --> 00:43:12.248
Your dad absolutely adored you.

00:43:12.878 --> 00:43:14.918
Man, he bought us pizza all the time.

00:43:16.788 --> 00:43:17.788
Oh, that's right.

00:43:18.418 --> 00:43:20.088
- He did. - Yes.

00:43:21.158 --> 00:43:22.488
That's how my dad was,

00:43:23.728 --> 00:43:24.828
and that's how I turned out.

00:43:28.968 --> 00:43:31.438
What? Are you feeling better already?

00:43:32.938 --> 00:43:34.138
Thanks to you.

00:43:34.708 --> 00:43:36.768
That's Han Woo Jin for you.

00:43:37.478 --> 00:43:39.908
Thanks to you, I feel fully recharged.

00:43:41.608 --> 00:43:42.978
I'm glad I came out, then.

00:43:43.408 --> 00:43:47.448
Tell me about it. What internship has a rich kid...

00:43:47.518 --> 00:43:49.288
stuck in the US for the entire summer break?

00:43:50.918 --> 00:43:52.658
You know it's my lot in life to do as I'm told.

00:43:56.088 --> 00:43:58.298
- So you're going back this year? - Yes.

00:43:59.958 --> 00:44:01.428
So I won't see you again before you leave.

00:44:04.738 --> 00:44:05.938
I'll see you during winter break, Eun Oh.

00:44:09.368 --> 00:44:10.368
Okay.

00:44:12.538 --> 00:44:13.578
Hey, Han Woo Jin.

00:44:14.108 --> 00:44:17.108
Next time you're back, you'd better call me right away, got it?

00:44:29.528 --> 00:44:30.828
Taxi!

00:44:36.968 --> 00:44:38.638
Su Bin, what are you doing here?

00:44:42.768 --> 00:44:43.808
I thought you were hailing a taxi.

00:44:48.008 --> 00:44:49.108
Just drive.

00:44:51.018 --> 00:44:52.018
Oh, you want a ride?

00:44:54.988 --> 00:44:55.988
What's this?

00:44:56.248 --> 00:44:57.248
A confession!

00:44:57.788 --> 00:44:59.588
What, did someone ask you out?

00:44:59.658 --> 00:45:01.428
No. I'm asking you out.

00:45:01.428 --> 00:45:02.688
Be my boyfriend.

00:45:13.068 --> 00:45:14.738
- Get out. - Wait.

00:45:14.738 --> 00:45:17.638
- Just get out of the car, Su Bin. - Seriously?

00:45:23.348 --> 00:45:25.648
Hey. Come on, hear me out first.

00:45:25.748 --> 00:45:26.748
Get out, and then we'll talk.

00:45:31.818 --> 00:45:32.988
You want me to say it out here?

00:45:33.488 --> 00:45:34.988
What is this nonsense?

00:45:35.458 --> 00:45:37.128
Look, I've been thinking about it.

00:45:38.458 --> 00:45:41.768
Don't you think we'd be a good match?

00:45:42.168 --> 00:45:43.168
Go out with me.

00:45:48.308 --> 00:45:49.808
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:55.978
That's why you had me on the show. It was all just a ploy, wasn't it?

00:45:56.048 --> 00:45:58.118
Come on. Don't be so mean.

00:45:58.118 --> 00:46:00.618
The show made me see you differently,

00:46:01.588 --> 00:46:04.788
and when I saw you met my standards, I made my move.

00:46:05.218 --> 00:46:07.418
So, do you like me?

00:46:07.628 --> 00:46:10.928
I'll grow to like you if we go out. I told you...

00:46:10.928 --> 00:46:13.098
I'd treat you really well once I fell for you.

00:46:13.958 --> 00:46:16.398
But Su Bin, for me...

00:46:16.468 --> 00:46:19.368
I can't date someone I don't like. And...

00:46:19.998 --> 00:46:22.468
There's already someone I like. I've liked her for a long time.

00:46:23.068 --> 00:46:27.508
Sure, whatever. Then why aren't you dating her?

00:46:27.778 --> 00:46:31.318
- She'd say yes in a heartbeat. - I never let on.

00:46:32.018 --> 00:46:35.018
But now, I've decided I'm going to.

00:46:35.248 --> 00:46:39.288
Liar. You decide that just when I confess?

00:46:39.788 --> 00:46:42.428
You're so predictable.

00:46:42.528 --> 00:46:44.628
Do you really think I'd fall for an excuse like that?

00:46:46.428 --> 00:46:49.798
I wouldn't lie to you. You're Ji Hyuk's little sister.

00:46:50.068 --> 00:46:54.068
Hey, can you please forget I'm Ji Hyuk's sister?

00:46:54.068 --> 00:46:57.438
I've clearly said no, and I told you there's someone else.

00:46:57.438 --> 00:47:00.238
So if you call me again for no good reason...

00:47:00.948 --> 00:47:02.508
I'm telling Ji Hyuk.

00:47:02.648 --> 00:47:06.218
- Gosh, you're unbelievable. - Hey.

00:47:06.548 --> 00:47:08.248
Your place is just one bus transfer away, right?

00:47:09.188 --> 00:47:11.758
What? I waited three hours for you,

00:47:12.818 --> 00:47:14.328
and you're not even going to give me a ride?

00:47:14.328 --> 00:47:17.328
No, I won't. Hey, here comes your bus.

00:47:17.328 --> 00:47:20.328
- Come on. Get on. - Come on!

00:47:21.128 --> 00:47:22.728
Come on.

00:47:42.518 --> 00:47:44.088
She's a real piece of work.

00:47:50.588 --> 00:47:53.598
- A thousand. - Oh, my. That's amazing.

00:47:53.698 --> 00:47:56.898
- You've already folded a thousand? - Yes.

00:47:57.168 --> 00:48:01.168
I should call it a day, get paid, and buy meat on my way home.

00:48:01.268 --> 00:48:03.438
So how much do you make a month?

00:48:09.978 --> 00:48:13.978
Is that for real? Oh, my goodness.

00:48:24.628 --> 00:48:25.628
Oh, no!

00:48:38.408 --> 00:48:42.678
- Don't worry about it. It's okay. - No, I insist.

00:48:42.748 --> 00:48:45.178
Our immune systems are weaker,

00:48:45.248 --> 00:48:48.788
so we can't ignore even a small cut. Here, let me see your hand.

00:48:48.888 --> 00:48:52.158
It's really all right. Here, let me do it myself.

00:48:52.218 --> 00:48:53.218
Come on.

00:48:56.188 --> 00:48:58.528
- Just let me. - Honestly.

00:49:07.738 --> 00:49:10.208
Listen.

00:49:10.938 --> 00:49:14.208
How many friends do you have that you see regularly?

00:49:14.978 --> 00:49:17.048
Friends to see? I don't really have any.

00:49:17.948 --> 00:49:20.878
They've all passed on or are in nursing homes.

00:49:23.918 --> 00:49:26.288
I don't have any in Seoul either.

00:49:27.018 --> 00:49:29.288
I have one buddy in a nursing home out of town,

00:49:29.788 --> 00:49:32.258
and another who's in a wheelchair after joint surgery.

00:49:33.928 --> 00:49:36.198
I barely see them once a year.

00:49:37.698 --> 00:49:38.938
I see.

00:49:44.738 --> 00:49:46.078
We...

00:49:46.678 --> 00:49:49.078
How have we managed to live this long?

00:49:54.588 --> 00:49:55.988
That's why we...

00:49:56.548 --> 00:49:58.258
So instead of the "in-law" business, let's just be friends.

00:50:00.618 --> 00:50:01.858
Friends?

00:50:02.558 --> 00:50:04.158
Come on, we're nearly 90.

00:50:05.828 --> 00:50:09.868
No more standing on ceremony or being awkward around each other.

00:50:09.928 --> 00:50:11.338
Let's just be friends.

00:50:11.868 --> 00:50:13.538
Let's just drop the whole "in-law" title.

00:50:15.908 --> 00:50:19.038
Times have certainly changed, but...

00:50:19.708 --> 00:50:20.938
I don't know if that's really okay.

00:50:34.658 --> 00:50:35.658
Myeong Hui.

00:50:36.588 --> 00:50:39.028
Da Jeong. What brings you here?

00:50:39.228 --> 00:50:41.598
I had an errand in the neighbourhood.

00:50:41.868 --> 00:50:44.498
I heard you were working here, so I thought I'd stop by.

00:50:44.568 --> 00:50:45.598
(Lee Myeong Hui)

00:50:45.668 --> 00:50:48.438
So the after-school care teacher job didn't work out?

00:50:50.068 --> 00:50:51.608
I should've listened to you from the start.

00:50:52.238 --> 00:50:55.608
You worked until you were 50 and still couldn't get a desk job.

00:50:55.748 --> 00:50:59.578
This job is fine, though. Being on your feet makes time fly.

00:51:00.078 --> 00:51:01.148
Really?

00:51:01.148 --> 00:51:04.588
That reminds me. They sometimes hold promo events.

00:51:05.118 --> 00:51:06.458
Want to give it a try for fun?

00:51:06.458 --> 00:51:08.688
It's a short gig, usually three days.

00:51:09.888 --> 00:51:11.358
Three days?

00:51:12.258 --> 00:51:13.728
I guess I could do that.

00:51:15.128 --> 00:51:16.298
Maybe I'll give it a shot.

00:51:16.468 --> 00:51:18.468
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

00:51:29.178 --> 00:51:30.308
Go out with me.

00:51:30.608 --> 00:51:34.548
I'll become a successful YouTuber and marry a rich man.

00:51:34.648 --> 00:51:36.518
I'll get married for sure.

00:51:36.848 --> 00:51:38.888
That's why I joined a matchmaking service.

00:51:43.988 --> 00:51:47.968
I'll send the revised schedule, so please give me any feedback.

00:51:48.128 --> 00:51:50.128
Many residents wanted the same dates,

00:51:50.128 --> 00:51:52.198
so I did a first pass of rescheduling.

00:51:52.268 --> 00:51:55.138
Please review it and get back to me. Sure.

00:51:55.368 --> 00:51:56.638
Okay, will do.

00:51:59.208 --> 00:52:00.278
(Hyunmyeong Apartments, Revised Schedule)

00:52:00.338 --> 00:52:01.748
(Sending)

00:52:02.908 --> 00:52:05.278
(Email sent)

00:52:09.488 --> 00:52:11.288
(Park Seong Jae)

00:52:13.488 --> 00:52:16.688
- Hey. - Ji Hyuk, let's get lunch.

00:52:16.958 --> 00:52:19.058
- How about sandwiches? - With me?

00:52:19.458 --> 00:52:20.458
Why?

00:52:21.368 --> 00:52:23.798
We could just eat at the cafe. You know, the one you like.

00:52:24.428 --> 00:52:27.168
Can't you just come and get some sun with me?

00:52:29.608 --> 00:52:31.678
Okay, I'll grab us some sandwiches.

00:52:32.378 --> 00:52:33.378
All right.

00:52:42.648 --> 00:52:44.218
So, are you making good use of that grant money?

00:52:46.018 --> 00:52:47.758
Yes, I'm working around the clock.

00:52:50.588 --> 00:52:52.428
Then it's time you called home, Ji Hyuk.

00:52:56.728 --> 00:52:58.368
Why are you making this so hard on yourself?

00:52:58.898 --> 00:53:00.668
You know they're not the type to hold a grudge.

00:53:03.308 --> 00:53:04.638
I'm the one holding a grudge.

00:53:05.038 --> 00:53:06.078
You are?

00:53:06.508 --> 00:53:09.048
- Why would you be holding a grudge? - Are you really asking me that?

00:53:11.778 --> 00:53:13.078
You wouldn't be asking if you knew.

00:53:15.518 --> 00:53:17.588
Just tell me straight for once.

00:53:17.748 --> 00:53:19.618
You want to know why I'm mad at my dad?

00:53:20.818 --> 00:53:22.928
Because he wouldn't let me do the one thing I loved.

00:53:27.598 --> 00:53:28.598
What are you...

00:53:29.298 --> 00:53:30.298
talking about?

00:53:32.038 --> 00:53:33.338
Seong Jae, you remember, right?

00:53:33.898 --> 00:53:35.768
What we planned to do in the US?

00:53:39.078 --> 00:53:43.578
You promised we'd be roommates and go to the same school.

00:53:46.348 --> 00:53:47.348
That's right.

00:53:47.918 --> 00:53:49.688
Going to Cornell for architecture.

00:53:50.748 --> 00:53:52.388
That's why you ended up at Cornell, right?

00:53:54.158 --> 00:53:55.158
Exactly.

00:53:56.328 --> 00:53:57.588
When I found out you couldn't go,

00:53:58.798 --> 00:54:00.258
I was sick about it for days.

00:54:05.968 --> 00:54:07.798
It must have been hard waiting.

00:54:08.768 --> 00:54:10.308
Of course, I'd wait.

00:54:10.368 --> 00:54:11.438
(2008, Ji Hyuk's high school freshman year)

00:54:11.508 --> 00:54:12.708
Son,

00:54:13.138 --> 00:54:16.108
I've been considering this very seriously for the past month.

00:54:19.148 --> 00:54:22.088
If I start saving everything now until you're a senior,

00:54:22.988 --> 00:54:24.688
I can send you to study in the US.

00:54:25.218 --> 00:54:27.118
Dad, really?

00:54:28.088 --> 00:54:31.058
But you must serve in the military after your freshman year of college.

00:54:31.128 --> 00:54:33.698
That'll give me another two years to keep saving.

00:54:34.158 --> 00:54:35.798
I've done my research.

00:54:35.798 --> 00:54:37.828
There are plenty of ways to get scholarships.

00:54:38.568 --> 00:54:40.498
Dad, thank you.

00:54:40.868 --> 00:54:41.968
Thank you so much.

00:54:42.308 --> 00:54:45.538
I swear I'll become the most famous architect in the world.

00:54:46.578 --> 00:54:49.148
I'll even work part-time jobs when I'm on leave from the military.

00:54:52.018 --> 00:54:53.018
Darn it.

00:54:54.048 --> 00:54:57.988
Ji Seung, hit your own stupid head. Don't take it out on your desk.

00:54:58.288 --> 00:55:00.888
Why don't I have a dream like Lee Ji Hyuk?

00:55:01.358 --> 00:55:04.698
I know, right? I'm so jealous of that punk Ji Hyuk.

00:55:05.258 --> 00:55:08.868
He's had a dream since 9th grade. To be an architect. The 9th grade!

00:55:09.528 --> 00:55:12.298
- And he'll study abroad. - Exactly.

00:55:12.598 --> 00:55:15.008
Come to think of it, our only dream is getting into college,

00:55:15.208 --> 00:55:18.208
but Ji Hyuk has already decided who he's going to be.

00:55:18.838 --> 00:55:20.178
(Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:55:20.238 --> 00:55:22.248
Hey, prepping for all this isn't easy, you know.

00:55:22.978 --> 00:55:25.278
- What a show-off. - Shut it.

00:55:26.448 --> 00:55:27.448
Seong Jae.

00:55:29.288 --> 00:55:32.988
Sorry, Seong Jae, I have to run. I'll be late for my drawing class.

00:55:33.058 --> 00:55:34.218
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

00:55:35.358 --> 00:55:37.428
- Hey, your dad's over there. - My dad?

00:55:40.698 --> 00:55:41.698
Dad?

00:55:44.568 --> 00:55:45.568
Dad.

00:55:45.968 --> 00:55:47.238
What do you mean?

00:55:47.638 --> 00:55:49.108
What do you mean I can't study abroad?

00:55:50.438 --> 00:55:53.808
Your grandpa was rushed to the hospital this morning.

00:55:54.908 --> 00:55:56.578
He had an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

00:55:56.978 --> 00:55:59.548
He had an eight-centimetre rupture and needed surgery.

00:55:59.978 --> 00:56:04.248
Okay, but what's that got to do with me?

00:56:06.788 --> 00:56:11.188
During the abdominal CT scan, they also found kidney cancer.

00:56:12.228 --> 00:56:14.258
They can't operate because of the holiday weekend,

00:56:14.768 --> 00:56:16.228
so he needs to be on medication.

00:56:17.998 --> 00:56:19.038
And the medicine...

00:56:19.468 --> 00:56:20.898
costs several thousand dollars a month.

00:56:23.338 --> 00:56:24.338
So...

00:56:25.878 --> 00:56:28.608
- I need your study abroad fund. - You can't be serious.

00:56:28.748 --> 00:56:31.548
What do you mean? Your grandfather's life is at risk.

00:56:33.648 --> 00:56:34.648
But still...

00:56:35.848 --> 00:56:37.348
Is there really no other way?

00:56:38.788 --> 00:56:39.858
Then what about me, Dad?

00:56:42.128 --> 00:56:43.928
You can just go to college here.

00:56:44.758 --> 00:56:46.698
I thought you wanted to be an architect.

00:56:47.428 --> 00:56:48.598
Do you have to go to the US for that?

00:56:50.768 --> 00:56:52.238
But I'm already a senior.

00:56:56.708 --> 00:56:57.768
Fine.

00:56:58.238 --> 00:57:00.978
- Forget it. - Hey, Ji Hyuk!

00:57:02.248 --> 00:57:03.248
Hey...

00:57:15.358 --> 00:57:17.088
Darn it. That kid, in this rain.

00:57:17.428 --> 00:57:18.658
Without an umbrella, too.

00:57:20.998 --> 00:57:23.068
(Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:57:25.438 --> 00:57:26.968
How is this fair?

00:57:28.038 --> 00:57:30.108
You promised you'd send me to study abroad.

00:57:30.568 --> 00:57:32.908
You promised when I was a freshman, and now I'm a senior.

00:57:34.108 --> 00:57:36.448
All Dad ever cares about is Grandpa.

00:57:37.448 --> 00:57:38.878
He's more important than I am!

00:57:39.218 --> 00:57:41.018
I'm nothing to him!

00:58:12.918 --> 00:58:14.178
That's when it hit me.

00:58:15.688 --> 00:58:17.488
Ever since Grandpa got hurt...

00:58:18.718 --> 00:58:21.758
I realised that's how my siblings and I had lived for 30 years.

00:58:28.028 --> 00:58:29.328
I saw my own future laid out for me.

00:58:31.198 --> 00:58:34.198
In that moment, I think I gave up on studying abroad and architecture.

00:58:37.138 --> 00:58:38.138
You...

00:58:39.108 --> 00:58:40.238
went through that?

00:58:40.678 --> 00:58:43.778
Back then, my dream was just denied.

00:58:44.978 --> 00:58:47.478
And it's not like you could blame anyone...

00:58:48.348 --> 00:58:49.388
or hold a grudge.

00:58:51.348 --> 00:58:52.418
But I felt like...

00:58:53.988 --> 00:58:55.728
my dream was crushed.

00:58:58.598 --> 00:59:00.428
I knew you were struggling,

00:59:01.768 --> 00:59:03.228
but I thought you accepted it pretty quickly.

00:59:07.298 --> 00:59:09.138
There are just some things you can't talk about, you know.

00:59:12.978 --> 00:59:15.048
Stories you can never bring yourself to share.

00:59:15.648 --> 00:59:16.778
There were.

00:59:18.178 --> 00:59:19.478
Even between us.

00:59:20.618 --> 00:59:21.848
Between us?

00:59:23.848 --> 00:59:24.848
But...

00:59:26.058 --> 00:59:27.318
things have been interesting for me lately.

00:59:30.088 --> 00:59:31.088
Really?

00:59:31.928 --> 00:59:32.928
Yes.

00:59:34.028 --> 00:59:36.198
Like why Ji Eun Oh did what she did back then...

00:59:37.268 --> 00:59:38.798
I think I'm starting to get it, just a little bit.

00:59:40.398 --> 00:59:42.168
By the way, you and Eun Oh...

00:59:46.578 --> 00:59:47.578
Actually, never mind.

01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:02.128
Just make it exactly like this house,

01:00:02.528 --> 01:00:04.388
a complete and perfect copy.

01:00:07.898 --> 01:00:10.598
Is there nothing specific you'd like to change?

01:00:11.128 --> 01:00:14.538
You're basically just asking me to make a copy.

01:00:15.608 --> 01:00:16.608
I see.

01:00:17.838 --> 01:00:19.008
Looks like she's getting plenty of requests.

01:00:19.008 --> 01:00:20.838
How about we change up some of the details?

01:00:22.078 --> 01:00:23.748
- Su Jeong. - Yes?

01:00:23.948 --> 01:00:27.118
Will no one be here when the cafe is closed? Including you?

01:00:27.178 --> 01:00:30.588
Right. I won't be here. Eun Oh can't come in.

01:00:30.688 --> 01:00:32.118
She'll be seeing Director Seong Jae.

01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:39.828
The coordinator interviews are late, so I'll see around 30 candidates.

01:00:40.298 --> 01:00:41.458
Thirty people in one day?

01:00:42.768 --> 01:00:45.638
Makes sense. You have 29 projects for that group contract alone.

01:00:47.038 --> 01:00:49.438
Okay, so the place will be free. I'll schedule interviews for then.

01:00:49.608 --> 01:00:50.608
Okay.

01:00:56.448 --> 01:00:58.308
I even have a detailed breakdown of the construction costs.

01:00:58.718 --> 01:01:01.718
If you can do it as specified, I'll sign the contract right away.

01:01:05.388 --> 01:01:07.358
(Estimate)

01:01:28.478 --> 01:01:29.948
This is so Ji Eun Oh.

01:01:34.478 --> 01:01:36.148
(Mamdaerozip)

01:01:36.248 --> 01:01:37.818
(Coordinator Inquiries)

01:01:41.088 --> 01:01:43.158
(Miso Apts: Turnkey Project)

01:01:43.228 --> 01:01:44.288
Turnkey...

01:01:44.358 --> 01:01:46.758
(Turnkey interior: An all-in-one service...)

01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:49.328
(handling the project from start to finish)

01:01:49.398 --> 01:01:50.728
(Elevator and site improvement)

01:02:17.388 --> 01:02:18.388
We need to talk.

01:02:19.328 --> 01:02:21.558
- I'm busy right now. - We're talking anyway.

01:02:23.068 --> 01:02:25.668
What is your problem? I'm trying to work late here.

01:02:26.538 --> 01:02:27.538
Let's be partners.

01:02:27.998 --> 01:02:29.308
Just you and me.

01:03:13.448 --> 01:03:16.388
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:16.518 --> 01:03:17.818
I knew it'd be you. Where's Ji Hyuk?

01:03:17.818 --> 01:03:20.488
- You scared me. - I said, where's Ji Hyuk?

01:03:20.988 --> 01:03:22.558
Now that you have funding,

01:03:22.558 --> 01:03:24.488
when will you find an office and move out?

01:03:24.588 --> 01:03:25.628
Hey, Lee Ji Hyuk!

01:03:25.858 --> 01:03:28.358
What's with the dress? She's definitely dressed for a date.

01:03:28.428 --> 01:03:31.028
Wait, since when? When did she get close to Seong Jae?

01:03:31.098 --> 01:03:32.738
How did that happen? Did they get close by trashing me?

01:03:32.798 --> 01:03:34.468
Just go on ten dates with me.

01:03:34.568 --> 01:03:38.138
You're really making me say it. Su Bin, I...

01:03:38.878 --> 01:03:42.408
- What? - About the secret I've kept buried.

01:03:42.608 --> 01:03:45.948
I lost my daughter.
