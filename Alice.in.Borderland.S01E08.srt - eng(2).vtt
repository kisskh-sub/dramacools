00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:23.398
- Oh, it's working.
- What?

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:25.900
Is that your phone, Asahi?

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.486
No, it's the one I picked up.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.198
Is it recording?

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.116
Yes.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.828
I'm pretty sure the camera's working.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:00:59.601
Unreal…

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:02.437
There's no one in this town.

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:07.358
Everyone in Tokyo
seems to have disappeared.

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.326
We're in Harajuku and no one's here.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.036
Yeah.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.214
What's going on?

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:38.848
There's not a living soul around.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.391
It's been five days now.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.562
Taking another video?
What are you gonna do with them?

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.147
Leaving a record.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.399
What's the point?

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.194
Someone might see it one day.

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:55.532
And after a little while,

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:58.118
we met someone.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:01.913
There was this place…

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.874
where we were taken to and…

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.504
When we got there, we started working.

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:17.804
Okay?

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.650
Are you seriously going in there?

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:47.041
It's pitch black in here.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.296
Momoka?

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:53.423
Momoka?

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:55.758
Momoka!

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.771
Fifteen minutes remaining.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.245
Kill 'em all.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.210
I…

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:57.797
I can't do this anymore.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.007
We've got no choice.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.638
We'll never be the same again
after killing so many people.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.059
Did you hear me?

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.314
Anyone who defies me here is the witch.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.570
Just shoot me then!

00:05:22.613 --> 00:05:23.573
That's enough!

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.622
This ends now!

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.838
You…

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:41.507
You had me tied up the whole time.

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:45.011
When the murder happened,
that's where I was.

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:47.722
So that means that you know that…

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.475
That I can't be the witch.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:57.982
And if you aren't the witch,
you don't need to kill me.

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:02.070
Just work with me
and we'll find the witch!

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:15.249
Arisu!

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:19.212
Stop it!

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:23.883
I know everything!

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:28.179
You're going after Arisu
even though you know he didn't do it.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.890
And that's…

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:32.475
because you're the witch!

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:36.062
Arisu!

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:44.654
Are ya…

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.406
the witch?

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:55.540
Yes.

00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:57.792
I am the witch.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:19.897
Go ahead.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:23.985
Do it!

00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:31.242
Well, shoot him!

00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:32.660
Aguni is not the witch!

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.415
It's a Ten of Hearts game!

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:40.001
It plays with your feelings
and your emotions!

00:07:40.668 --> 00:07:42.920
You're not gonna win by killing Aguni.

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.922
That's not the way this game works.

00:07:52.054 --> 00:07:53.473
I know you're not the witch.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.766
So why then?

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.978
You gotta have another reason.

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:02.106
What are you saying?

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:05.693
The one that you killed

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:07.737
wasn't Momoka.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:10.531
It was Hatter.

00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:13.159
What?

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.334
I could see it right away in your eyes.

00:08:22.793 --> 00:08:25.087
It was as if you lost all hope and…

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:27.548
just gave up.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.634
I had the same feeling…

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:33.012
when I killed my friends.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:39.894
You're not dumb.

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.439
But as soon as you took over,
you wanted to kill everyone.

00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:45.775
And that's not like you.

00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:49.070
So you…

00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:50.988
…had to have another motive.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.993
Ever since I came to the Beach,

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.162
I couldn't quite figure it out.

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:01.999
If you had possession of all these guns,

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.336
why didn't the militant corps take over
a long time ago?

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.005
That never happened until now.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:10.883
Because in the end,

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:14.345
you weren't against Hatter at all.

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.932
Didn't you actually help each other out?

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.520
You wanted to make sure that…

00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:25.147
scary people like Niragi
don't go ballistic.

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:28.234
You tried to hold them back.

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:38.703
I know…

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.832
how close you and Hatter were.

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.709
You were best friends, weren't you?

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.630
Then, why did you kill him?

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.261
I'll tell you why.

00:09:57.054 --> 00:10:00.141
Because you could never forgive him
for what he did.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:06.022
You wanted it all to stop,
but it was too late.

00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:13.779
You didn't recognize him anymore,
isn't that right?

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:42.516
These crazy games…

00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:45.686
They're gonna continue?

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.112
I will create a utopia here.
An oasis.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.950
For all of those out there
who have lost hope…

00:11:03.954 --> 00:11:05.706
I offer the possibility

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.875
of a better life!

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.339
This will be where hope is born.

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:18.302
That's impossible.

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:20.596
Really?

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.018
We can do it together.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.486
Hear my words now.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.030
We're all in this together.

00:11:39.323 --> 00:11:42.493
We're going to unite
and gather all the cards…

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.079
and get back to the world we knew!

00:11:57.633 --> 00:11:58.718
Idiots…

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.513
thought they could hide
their playing cards from me.

00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:25.995
Aguni.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.626
As of this day,

00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:38.048
there will be a new rule.

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:49.226
"Death to any traitor."

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.902
You don't know anything!

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:07.536
Stop it!

00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:24.804
You know nothing.

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:27.973
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:39.777
This way.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.290
Congratulations.

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:10.266
That brings back memories.

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:14.478
This place really hasn't changed at all.

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:20.943
Look…

00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:24.321
I'm done.

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.952
We're losing control of Niragi
and the militant corps.

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:35.624
Let's get rid of the Beach.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:41.338
Get rid of it?

00:14:43.757 --> 00:14:45.885
Every member of the Beach

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:50.097
is consumed with the happiness
that they found there.

00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:53.058
Getting back to the old world
by gathering a few cards

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:54.977
was just a lie you came up with.

00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:00.441
We need to end this.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.111
So you're…

00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:06.488
betraying me, then?

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.915
"Death to any traitor," right?

00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:20.920
That's the rule of the Beach,
remember that.

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:22.504
The Beach means nothing!

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.506
Just stop this.

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:30.971
I wanted to instill hope,
to create a utopia!

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:33.557
It's bullshit, and you know it!

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:36.352
There is no hope here.

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:41.440
This world we're in…

00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:44.860
has crushed all hope.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:56.288
You see,

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:01.460
I used to have friends with me
I could trust.

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:05.923
But all the hope I had…

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.469
died along with them.

00:16:27.444 --> 00:16:28.904
Sometimes, a king…

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.118
is in a position where he has
to make decisions

00:16:34.201 --> 00:16:35.619
that are painfully hard.

00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:42.710
Like right now,

00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:45.379
my friend.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.655
I know what it feels like
to see your friends die.

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.993
To kill them, I see it.

00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:20.039
You killed your friend.
I see it in your eyes.

00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:24.418
And now you just wanna kill everyone here,

00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:27.713
because they were the ones
who made your friend crazy.

00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:34.928
These painful feelings of yours,
the game master is using all of them.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.641
That's why it's a game of Hearts.
Don't you get that?

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.935
Shut up!

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:42.853
Arisu!

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:46.565
So if all of this is true, then…

00:17:46.648 --> 00:17:49.860
Aguni wanted to kill everyone
no matter what the game was.

00:17:51.987 --> 00:17:53.572
He had you do it.

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:56.867
And we said nothing
and went along with it all.

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:03.248
So, who here is the witch then?

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.751
I know who it is.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.213
I know who the real witch is.

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:16.929
{\an8}A game master…

00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:19.473
{\an8}uses similar characteristics
in every game.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.435
In a game of Hearts,

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:27.356
he usually makes a fool out of everyone.

00:18:28.857 --> 00:18:31.610
Difficulty, Seven of Hearts.

00:18:31.693 --> 00:18:34.404
A game of betrayal plays with our hearts.

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:35.405
It's bullshit!

00:18:38.742 --> 00:18:40.911
It looks like the wolf
is the one that needs to hide!

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:44.164
{\an8}It might be that…

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.043
…there really was a way to end the game…

00:18:50.003 --> 00:18:51.964
without having to kill everyone.

00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.342
A solution where…

00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:58.637
nobody has to get hurt,

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:00.889
and no one has to die.

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:05.435
But… that's impossible.

00:19:06.603 --> 00:19:08.605
We have to hunt down the witch

00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:10.649
and burn them
in the Fire of Judgment, right?

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.360
No.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:24.079
The witch could be right here and…

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:26.832
no one dies.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:32.462
Because it's…

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:36.758
Momoka. She was the witch all along.

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:54.776
So, wait.
She stabbed herself in the chest?

00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:57.112
Yes.

00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:01.742
If I were the game master…

00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:03.619
…that's what I would come up with.

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.711
You're full of shit!

00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:14.213
I'm the witch!

00:20:15.422 --> 00:20:18.342
You all wanna kill me, right?

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:31.897
Aguni's trying
to take everyone down with him.

00:21:26.576 --> 00:21:28.078
Oh, Takeru.

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:33.500
Hey.

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:36.920
Takeru. Takeru.

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:40.465
Takeru!

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:51.018
This Beach made him crazy.

00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:52.352
Do you hear me?

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:54.730
You guys made him crazy!

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.193
Kill me, I'm the witch!

00:22:05.365 --> 00:22:08.201
Listen.
I know how to stop Aguni, trust me!

00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:11.705
I'll get his attention, all right?

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:14.041
Burn Momoka in the Fire of Judgment.

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:16.877
Arisu.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.089
This whole thing has to stop now, okay?

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:27.554
Asahi!

00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:31.725
Everyone!

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.146
I'm the one!

00:22:36.229 --> 00:22:38.482
The dealer of this game!

00:23:10.013 --> 00:23:11.473
It was a reverse grip.

00:23:16.853 --> 00:23:20.816
Fingerprints with a reverse grip
were found on the knife.

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:31.243
That means

00:23:32.452 --> 00:23:34.704
that Momoka grabbed
the handle of the knife

00:23:35.455 --> 00:23:37.332
and stabbed it through her own chest.

00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:47.217
She was the witch.

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:53.890
But why would she do that?

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:56.601
It couldn't have been just for the game.

00:23:57.561 --> 00:24:00.772
So Momoka was really…
the game master after all?

00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:04.317
And that girl said she was the dealer.

00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:09.990
So they were just toying with us
the whole time, then?

00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:15.579
So there was never any high power
doing all this?

00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:17.497
They were just human?

00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:22.752
But it's possible that…

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:26.965
they could've been
controlled by somebody else.

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:34.848
Aguni.

00:24:38.518 --> 00:24:39.769
We need to stop this.

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:43.315
No more innocent people have to die.

00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:46.151
Too many people have already.

00:24:50.238 --> 00:24:54.451
I understand how it feels…
to kill your friends.

00:24:55.785 --> 00:24:57.329
But we can't take it out on…

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.624
people who are still alive!

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:04.961
We are still alive!

00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:08.256
We're all in this together…

00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:12.135
and we have to fight to end it all!

00:25:15.972 --> 00:25:18.892
I don't want anybody else to die!

00:25:51.091 --> 00:25:52.342
The fire is spreading!

00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:55.303
Run!

00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:01.017
- Hurry! Put her in the Fire of Judgment!
- Hurry, run!

00:26:12.362 --> 00:26:13.196
That hurt.

00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:22.205
If I could do it all over again,

00:26:24.874 --> 00:26:28.461
I'd use this Fire of Judgment
to burn this whole place down!

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.339
- Niragi…
- Niragi?

00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:36.011
And that will make me the winner!

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:10.337
Get off me!

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.759
I'm gonna kill you!

00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:33.568
You are dead.

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:36.112
I'll kill you all!

00:27:58.385 --> 00:27:59.678
Aguni.

00:28:09.604 --> 00:28:12.273
Three minutes
remaining in the game.

00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:13.566
We need to hurry!

00:28:17.696 --> 00:28:18.655
Grab her legs.

00:28:18.738 --> 00:28:20.323
Ready? Now lift!

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:28.248
Come on!

00:28:29.457 --> 00:28:31.459
Hurry! Move, move, move!

00:29:23.553 --> 00:29:25.013
Congratulations.

00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:27.015
GAME CLEARED
CONGRATULATIONS

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:37.859
There is no safe place
for us in this world.

00:29:43.406 --> 00:29:46.951
When the first explorers
discovered the north pole,

00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:48.995
the world was unspoiled

00:29:49.078 --> 00:29:52.040
and spared of the burden of civilization.

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:58.922
And when it is all said and done,
we simply return to the soil.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.967
This land

00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:05.720
is a mirror to the world.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.599
I am thankful to this place.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.478
For now…

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:18.358
I'm freer than ever before.

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:46.594
This is the end of our paradise.

00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:56.646
So many of us died.

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:18.459
I don't think I…

00:31:19.502 --> 00:31:20.795
can ever forgive them.

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:25.425
- Let me go!
- You can't.

00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:29.804
But they…

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:32.473
They killed 'em all!

00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:34.517
I can't let that go!

00:31:58.499 --> 00:31:59.584
Let's stop this.

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:04.255
Everyone here, we're still alive.

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:08.343
And that's all that matters right now.

00:32:10.845 --> 00:32:12.138
That's all that matters.

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:14.223
Arisu?

00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:16.100
Arisu!

00:32:34.077 --> 00:32:35.286
I get it now.

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:42.669
I understand.

00:32:43.544 --> 00:32:44.587
Arisu…

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:33.052
You never quit, do you?

00:33:38.057 --> 00:33:41.394
I was starting to think
collecting these cards was pointless.

00:33:41.477 --> 00:33:43.021
What do you think now?

00:33:44.439 --> 00:33:45.732
I'm thinking that…

00:33:47.108 --> 00:33:49.777
we still haven't seen
any of the face cards.

00:33:52.488 --> 00:33:57.118
And so what is it
the game's controllers want us to see?

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:09.797
- Is it recording?
- Yes.

00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:13.760
I'm pretty sure the camera's working.

00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:19.307
What is this?

00:34:20.183 --> 00:34:22.143
It's a video that Asahi left behind.

00:34:25.104 --> 00:34:26.189
Unreal…

00:34:27.982 --> 00:34:29.442
There's no one in this town.

00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:34.030
Everyone in Tokyo
seems to have disappeared.

00:34:36.866 --> 00:34:38.159
And after a little while,

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.953
we met someone.

00:34:43.164 --> 00:34:44.332
There was this place…

00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:47.126
where we were taken to and…

00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:51.798
When we got there, we started working.

00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.470
We helped with…

00:34:58.513 --> 00:35:00.640
preparing and executing the games.

00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:05.561
Are you seriously going in there?

00:35:15.238 --> 00:35:17.323
There are people known as dealers

00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:20.118
who help facilitate the games.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:29.127
Sometimes we actually join the games
or act as taggers.

00:35:30.503 --> 00:35:33.005
Everyone thinks
we are just regular players,

00:35:33.923 --> 00:35:36.134
and part of our job is to confuse them.

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:38.719
But…

00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:42.723
during the games,
we're being watched the entire time,

00:35:43.683 --> 00:35:47.436
and we'll be killed if anyone
ever finds out that we're the dealers.

00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:52.859
Are you recording again?
What are you gonna do if they find out?

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:15.423
BEWARE OF ELECTROCUTION
TRAIN CABLES ABOVE

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:26.642
Is this where the game master is?

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:16.901
Stop!

00:37:18.778 --> 00:37:20.571
They're really going at it!

00:37:36.504 --> 00:37:38.172
All right, yes, yes!

00:37:45.137 --> 00:37:47.306
DEALER WINS

00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:54.480
Who are they?

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.443
So these are all the game masters?

00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:12.164
So many have died.

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:16.627
I remember one girl around our age.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.173
Our job was…

00:38:21.757 --> 00:38:23.926
…to make sure the game went
the way they wanted it,

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.221
and we joined in.

00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:29.515
And we made sure many players died.

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:32.101
Because of us,

00:38:33.936 --> 00:38:35.896
many people die every day.

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:41.902
I can't take this anymore.

00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:47.658
We kill people, win the game,

00:38:48.451 --> 00:38:49.910
and earn visa days.

00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:57.501
We get to live for another two weeks,

00:38:57.585 --> 00:38:59.962
but I don't even know
how many people I've…

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:04.091
I can't do it anymore.

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.470
Momoka.

00:39:08.971 --> 00:39:11.515
This is all a dream.

00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:16.145
It's all right.

00:39:17.146 --> 00:39:19.190
We're going to wake up
from this nightmare soon.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.622
I want it all to be over…

00:40:05.027 --> 00:40:06.195
So this is it.

00:40:43.732 --> 00:40:44.859
There it is.

00:40:51.407 --> 00:40:56.912
BEWARE OF ELECTROCUTION
TRAIN CABLES ABOVE

00:43:00.786 --> 00:43:02.246
I don't believe it.

00:43:12.506 --> 00:43:14.800
So you actually
found this place.

00:43:21.056 --> 00:43:23.350
I expected no less from you.

00:43:26.895 --> 00:43:28.188
Long time no see.

00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:32.151
What's going on?

00:43:34.528 --> 00:43:38.324
Thanks to you two, I have
all the numbered playing cards right here.

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:40.242
Thank you.

00:43:42.411 --> 00:43:44.079
How did you find this place?

00:43:47.082 --> 00:43:50.085
It took me a while,
but I figured out that this is actually

00:43:50.169 --> 00:43:52.087
the map of a subway station.

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:10.773
So what happens
when we collect all the cards?

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:15.527
I thought coming here
would provide me with an answer.

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:19.740
But I gotta tell you,
I only know one thing.

00:44:20.532 --> 00:44:22.868
These people aren't the game masters,
are they?

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.371
Right.

00:44:26.455 --> 00:44:27.748
What's pretty clear is

00:44:28.415 --> 00:44:30.876
they were all killed after our victory.

00:44:31.543 --> 00:44:34.838
They're just humans like us,
and the kicker is…

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.633
there's someone above them.

00:44:45.474 --> 00:44:47.935
So, then… who could they be?

00:44:49.395 --> 00:44:50.396
Who knows?

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:52.898
Maybe aliens.

00:44:55.442 --> 00:44:56.735
Maybe God.

00:45:05.452 --> 00:45:08.163
SPECIAL URGENT BROADCAST

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:15.462
Congratulations to all players.

00:45:19.174 --> 00:45:20.300
Huh?

00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:22.761
Oh.

00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:28.267
Mira.

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:32.479
Except for the face cards,

00:45:33.021 --> 00:45:35.482
you've all completed the numbered games

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.901
and emerged victorious.

00:45:38.944 --> 00:45:41.613
And the prize of these sweet victories

00:45:41.697 --> 00:45:44.575
was the sacrifice of many lives.

00:45:49.163 --> 00:45:50.205
I wonder…

00:45:51.498 --> 00:45:54.501
just how many
of your close friends have died?

00:45:59.465 --> 00:46:01.049
Do you remember…

00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:05.554
…the ones who were shot in the head?

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:10.768
That girl you burned alive…

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:17.065
The ones struck down by lasers…

00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:20.360
Or the ones who drowned?

00:46:23.155 --> 00:46:24.865
Help me!

00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:26.992
The ones whose heads were blown off?

00:46:27.701 --> 00:46:29.244
Your friends.

00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:34.333
All that despair you felt…

00:46:34.416 --> 00:46:35.584
Karube!

00:46:35.667 --> 00:46:39.254
Those gruesome scenes,
you'll never forget them.

00:46:42.508 --> 00:46:43.675
And that…

00:46:44.426 --> 00:46:46.011
…really touches me.

00:46:52.226 --> 00:46:54.144
To all surviving players,

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:56.271
we just wanted

00:46:57.564 --> 00:46:59.191
to give you a present.

00:47:00.734 --> 00:47:02.820
Going back to our world?

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:07.407
There will be new games!

00:47:10.285 --> 00:47:13.956
Let's all play,
and this time with all the face cards!

00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:16.792
New games?

00:47:18.085 --> 00:47:19.670
I don't hate that idea.

00:47:21.713 --> 00:47:26.051
We've got so many more wonderful
and exciting games in store for you all,

00:47:26.802 --> 00:47:28.095
so be prepared.

00:47:30.722 --> 00:47:32.015
So then…

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.351
Is she the game master?

00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:38.313
I think I'd rather see an alien up there.

00:47:39.606 --> 00:47:42.609
The next stage starts tomorrow,

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.445
when the clock strikes noon.

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:48.240
Let's have some fun,

00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:50.492
all together!

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.996
So we have to fight once again.

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:56.290
Yeah.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.877
But there's one difference.

00:48:03.422 --> 00:48:05.883
Now we know what our target looks like.

00:48:46.882 --> 00:48:49.551
{\an8}SHIBUYA CENTER STREET

00:48:51.386 --> 00:48:53.305
SHIBUYA STATION

00:49:33.553 --> 00:49:35.597
That's where we'll find our answers.
