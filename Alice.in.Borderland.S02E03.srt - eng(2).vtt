00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.064
Hey, this isn't tight enough.

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.817
- Right. Sorry about that.
- And look there.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.278
That jack's in the wrong position, man.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.488
Someone could get hurt.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.074
I already explained this to you.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:36.077
Why can't you do anything right, huh?

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.287
I'm sorry.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.205

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.625
Kato keeps riding my ass
like I'm a stupid newbie.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.963
I can't work every day of the week
with no time off.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.591
I'm not like my dad.
He died from working too much.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.511
I'm doing this now,
but once I get enough money,

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.221
I'm gonna take some courses,

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:56.806
and I'll quit that dump.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.600
Then I'll do something really worthwhile.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.185
I'm sorry you feel like that.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.648
I plan to keep on
working hard at that dump.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.817
I like it there.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.111
Oh. I didn't…

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:13.156
Kato keeps riding you
because you have a bad attitude.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.118
You might learn to do the job right
before shitting on it.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:20.497
Sure, it might not be
the most exciting job,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.167
but I work my ass off every single day,
get my paycheck,

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.503
and go home to my grateful family.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.507
Has anyone ever
been grateful to you for anything?

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.891
Hurry up now.

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.976
- Move it.
- Yes, sir.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.729
I'll take off the splash shield.
You remove the jack.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.231
Yes, sir.

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:07.961
Get him out!

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:10.004
Hey, move! Get the car up!

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:11.422
- Okay, go!
- Get it up!

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:12.507
Get it up!

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.134
- A whole turn!
- Hang on, Kato!

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:16.469
- It's up! Hang on, almost there.
- Okay!

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.138
- It's up. It's up.
- Kato, you okay?

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.430
- Move it. Move!
- Come on.

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:20.640
- Easy. Easy…
- Okay.

00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:21.724
- Get him out.
- Come on.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.018
Easy.

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:25.311
You're okay.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:26.354
- It's okay.
- Ugh!

00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:28.857
- Don't stand there! Call an ambulance!
- Are you all right?

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.108
- Are you okay?
- Kato!

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.484
- Kato!
- Look at his arm!

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:34.362
The jack slipped!

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.656
- Kato, hey!
- Hang in there, man!

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.741
Hold it! Easy. Easy. Don't try to get up.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.493
Kato decided to quit.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.079
Why?

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.124
What do you think? He has no choice.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.669
His hand is completely useless now.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.133
You should leave. Get out!

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.849
- Thank you.
- There it is.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.518
- Yeah.
- Guys, break out those shocks.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:06.686
- You know the ones?
- Anyway…

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.857
- I don't know when he's coming back.
- Do you know, uh… if he's coming back?

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.533
- It kind of slipped out, man.
- Yeah.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.785
That Tatta is an idiot.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.330
I don't know. I don't know if…

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.211
- …they rushed him to the hospital…
- He's all right…

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:14.272
Nine minutes remain.

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:17.567
The King of Clubs team is leading
by 500 points.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.804
Aah! You bastard!

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:49.724
What the fuck are you doing?

00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:52.018
I just wanted to have a little fun
with your girlfriend

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:53.436
before this stupid game was over!

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:55.897
You asshole!

00:05:57.523 --> 00:05:59.567
Sure, you act like a hero.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.195
But I know you're just like me!

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:05.114
I fucking hate how you walk around
like you're full of hope.

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:08.743
Except now I can finally see
that hope draining out of you.

00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:11.412
And I'll die happy
knowing how pathetic you are.

00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:29.597
Eight minutes left.

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:32.975
Seems like the enemy is laying low.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.562
It's over, I guess.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.400
What a letdown, huh?

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:41.984
That's just how the game goes.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.278
There's no time left
for them to do anything.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.783
I think I'm gonna take a walk.

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.807
This feels like an eternity.

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.102
Just waiting here to die.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.998
Arisu. I'm sorry.

00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:38.791
I couldn't fight.

00:07:40.084 --> 00:07:41.919
I couldn't help you in the end.

00:07:42.503 --> 00:07:43.504
Usagi,

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.840
I should apologize to you.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:47.967
I'm sorry.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.988
I'm sure

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.366
if we went back, I'd still hate it there.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.327
No, staying here won't change that.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.745
Usagi--

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:20.208
You can't push people
into following you for no reason.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:22.627
You have to be ready to listen.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.171
Wait for them to come to you.

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:30.468
Seven minutes remain.

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:56.827
You decided to come.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:03.209
Something told me
that I would see you here.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.840
Something told me the same thing.

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.594
That's why I came.

00:09:14.762 --> 00:09:17.139
To see if you might be
waiting for me here.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.228
The ocean is wide.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:25.898
That's why we're drawn to it.

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:29.402
We want to commune
with something bigger than we are.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.956
Your team beat ours.

00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:48.963
So do you have any regrets?

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:52.967
To be honest,

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.596
I'm a bit disappointed.

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:01.058
Five minutes remain.

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:06.063
Please, tell me, Kyuma.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.819
I need to know the answer.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.739
Before I die.

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:17.992
You know that I can't.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.828
You've given up.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.459
I thought you'd say that.

00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:34.675
Well, then…

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.179
what about

00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:41.515
one last handshake

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:43.726
before I go?

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.104
What would you say to that?

00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:49.565
Handshake?

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.901
The game isn't over yet.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.487
If we shake hands now,

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.989
we would have to battle, and I'd win.

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:05.373
I finally realized something about myself,

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:09.669
because of what you said.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:13.964
I should have been ready to listen.

00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:18.427
I should have waited
for them to come to me.

00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:22.014
Let them know they could depend on me.

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:26.811
And maybe we could've

00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:29.522
understood each other
a little better then.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.988
I know we're enemies.

00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:43.077
You're my opponent.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:49.500
And I know it might seem
like I'm being crazy.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.590
But I still really want to say thank you.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:01.721
Thank you for helping me
realize those things.

00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:12.356
I know that… I don't have much time left
to do anything else.

00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:17.069
I know I'm gonna die.

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.489
So please,

00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:25.369
let me shake the hand of the one…

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.081
…who showed me my true self.

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:45.389
All right.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.101
Since it's my opponent's dying wish,

00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:51.687
I'd be honored to grant it to you.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.485
Thank you, Kyuma.

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:00.362
Arisu.

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:03.532
Getting to battle with you

00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:05.993
was a great pleasure.

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:21.842
The scores have been updated.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:26.680
Uh… huh?

00:13:27.264 --> 00:13:28.349
Huh?

00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:33.729
Is this for real?

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:38.192
The player team is leading
by 500 points.

00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:41.070
KYUMA: 14,000 LOSE
ARISU & TATTA: 14,950 WIN

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:47.201
What?

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:50.746
14,950 points?

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:53.582
What kind of trick is this?

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:56.460
It's not a trick at all.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.804
Seven minutes remain.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.845
What are you doing? Stop it!

00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:49.555
Getting the wristband off of me!

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:50.723
Stop!

00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:56.604
It's no use.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.064
I can't get it off.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.568
Pathetic.

00:15:04.486 --> 00:15:05.654
Arisu.

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:08.282
You gotta do it.

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:11.535
What do you mean, get it off?

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.331
Well, I figured out a plan.

00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.625
There's 10,100 points here.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:22.379
If you hold onto it hidden in your pocket,
it'll be like there's two of us.

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:25.466
Then our team might be able
to win that way.

00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:28.344
Tatta, I can't. No!

00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:31.889
They never said anything
about taking the wristband off.

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:37.353
Please, Arisu!

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:41.231
I don't think I can do it.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:43.859
Please, there's no time!

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:45.736
Do it for me!

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:58.165
We can win this way.

00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:03.212
Everybody's life is on the line here!

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.296
What are you waiting for?

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.882
Six minutes remain.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.426
Otherwise everyone will die!

00:16:12.262 --> 00:16:13.347
Arisu!

00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:15.391
Do it!

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:20.813
You've just gotta do it, okay? Hurry!

00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:22.648
I can't.

00:16:23.607 --> 00:16:26.527
Please, or you'll kill everyone!
Do it for them!

00:16:28.278 --> 00:16:29.363
Just go!

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:31.573
Do it!

00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:35.202
Arisu!

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:38.747
Do it!

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:11.697
Tatta!

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.948
I'm sorry.

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.408
I'm sorry!

00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:16.160
No.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.203
I'm sorry I made you do it.

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.122
I'm sure it was hard.

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:29.798
- Quick, take it.
- I've gotta stop the bleeding!

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:31.300
Just take it!

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:43.937
Arisu.

00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:47.733
Remember when you thanked me earlier?

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:51.278
I felt so much joy.

00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:55.032
It was like

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.367
I was the hero for once.

00:17:59.995 --> 00:18:01.830
I promise I'll be fine.

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.999
Don't worry, I'm not gonna die from this.

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:08.629
Hurry up, or everyone else will die!

00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:10.339
Go on!

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:13.842
Go!

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:15.469
Just go!

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.369
Whoa…

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:45.749
You are way more screwed up
than I thought.

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.546
I won the game, thanks to my friend.

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:57.678
Wow. I guess we finally lost the game.

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:04.226
So even someone as wise as you

00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:07.771
is still afraid of death?

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.399
No.

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:14.653
I'm thinking about my friend Shitara,
who died earlier.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.868
He said that if I let him die in vain,

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.496
he'd beat the shit out of me
in the afterlife,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.914
and I know he meant it.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:30.210
And all my teammates
are gonna be disappointed in me.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.175
I'm sorry.

00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:42.848
You were the one who set the tone.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:47.436
We were all equals in this game,
and we gave everything.

00:19:48.478 --> 00:19:49.813
With all our hearts.

00:19:51.064 --> 00:19:53.567
I've never had this much passion
for anything.

00:19:56.403 --> 00:19:57.946
And you showed me how.

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:01.533
Kyuma,

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.829
you guys were a team before this,
weren't you?

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:13.420
Kyuma, you asshole.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:17.382
I guess he dropped his guard
right at the end.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.221
Well, aren't you the one to talk?

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.641
Yeah, you're right.

00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:28.018
Without Kyuma,

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:32.147
none of our sorry asses
would have made it this far in the game.

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:35.692
We can't hold him responsible
for anything.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.986
That's right.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.657
Thanks, Kyuma.

00:20:43.283 --> 00:20:44.576
It was pretty fun.

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:49.790
We'll do some more stupid shit
on the other side.

00:20:59.174 --> 00:21:01.134
Kyuma.

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:05.931
You love your friends
as much as I love mine.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:11.603
And with every single game,
you kept on risking your lives.

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:14.356
But you kept winning,

00:21:15.899 --> 00:21:17.192
and progressing more.

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:20.320
We're all doing the same thing.

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:23.407
Everyone just wants to stop
playing the game.

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:27.911
Isn't that right?

00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:35.752
But it seems like,
even if you win them all,

00:21:36.586 --> 00:21:39.089
you still just become
citizens of Borderland.

00:21:39.172 --> 00:21:41.425
So do we get to go back
to where we came from?

00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:46.096
Tell me the truth.

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:49.933
Do we get to go back?

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:58.900
If that's what your intuition is saying,

00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:02.154
then maybe that's your truth.

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:10.329
What kind of an answer is that?

00:22:14.791 --> 00:22:16.293
Come on, man.

00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:26.386
So there's…

00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:30.599
there's no point
in playing any of these games.

00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:33.977
Do you think you'll find out
if you stop playing?

00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:40.692
Well, what is it all supposed to mean?

00:22:46.948 --> 00:22:48.367
I don't think I can do it.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.581
I'm never gonna be as strong as you are.

00:22:56.124 --> 00:22:58.168
You'll never be like me, Arisu,

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.295
and you shouldn't want that.

00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:03.757
You're playing your own game.

00:23:05.008 --> 00:23:06.760
You're the master of your own fate.

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:13.100
No time remains.

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:19.398
It is game over for the King of Clubs
team, as they ended with fewer points.

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:20.899
Arisu.

00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:24.319
Good luck to you.

00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:34.704
I don't want you to die!

00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:39.584
When we first met,

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:42.629
we knew that one of us was going to die.

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:46.007
If we hadn't met playing this game,
who's to say--

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:48.510
The only reason we became this close

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:51.346
was because we met playing the game.

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:56.268
But if we had met somewhere else,

00:23:59.354 --> 00:24:01.815
then maybe we could have
actually been friends.

00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:07.737
We've been friends this whole time.

00:24:10.532 --> 00:24:11.408
Arisu.

00:24:13.493 --> 00:24:15.078
I hope you figure it out.

00:24:17.497 --> 00:24:19.082
How to live by your own rules.

00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:21.418
Your life is yours.

00:24:22.752 --> 00:24:24.504
Don't follow someone else's path.

00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:37.642
It was an honor playing with you.

00:24:52.949 --> 00:24:54.367
So this is the end.

00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:57.787
I had a great life.

00:25:02.709 --> 00:25:04.836
I lived it without a single regret.

00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:11.718
And I know that I'm ready to die.

00:25:55.804 --> 00:25:57.138
Kyuma.

00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:02.185
The player team wins.

00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:54.904
Usagi? Usagi!

00:27:01.244 --> 00:27:02.370
Kuina.

00:27:02.996 --> 00:27:04.247
We won.

00:27:07.167 --> 00:27:08.627
What? Really?

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.006
PLAYER TEAM
CONGRATULATIONS

00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:15.342
Arisu must have saved us somehow.

00:27:19.262 --> 00:27:20.221
We won?

00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:31.775
Tatta, are you okay?

00:27:31.858 --> 00:27:32.984
Tatta!

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:34.486
Hang on, Tatta!

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:41.368
Just hang on.

00:27:44.245 --> 00:27:45.288
Tatta.

00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:50.543
Tatta.

00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:54.255
Tatta,

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.174
we won.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.593
We won,

00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:00.970
and it's all thanks to you.

00:28:02.639 --> 00:28:03.848
Sweet.

00:28:07.435 --> 00:28:09.521
Hey, come on, Tatta.

00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:11.523
Keep it together, all right?

00:28:12.315 --> 00:28:13.233
Tatta.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.986
You see?

00:28:18.863 --> 00:28:20.073
When I try,

00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:21.950
I can

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:24.160
be great.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.997
Yeah. You are great.

00:28:28.748 --> 00:28:30.333
We won because of you, Tatta.

00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:34.546
Thank you.

00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:44.389
Hey, Tatta!

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.559
Tatta! Don't go!

00:28:49.018 --> 00:28:49.978
Don't you go!

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:51.438
Tatta!

00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:53.565
Tatta!

00:28:53.648 --> 00:28:56.234
Oh no. Just hang on, Tatta!

00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:58.153
Tatta!

00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:00.530
Come on!

00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:02.282
Tatta!

00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:04.659
Tatta!

00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:08.580
Tatta,

00:29:09.622 --> 00:29:11.040
don't leave me.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.829
It's a pretty view.

00:29:52.207 --> 00:29:54.167
This is a nice place to rest.

00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:55.960
Yeah.

00:30:08.223 --> 00:30:09.432
We can't…

00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:13.436
let his death be for nothing.

00:30:17.565 --> 00:30:19.234
We need to keep going,

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:22.111
to keep Tatta's memory alive.

00:30:38.962 --> 00:30:41.214
I'm so fucking pissed off that I survived,

00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:43.800
and it's all because of you.

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:47.387
Even so,

00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:51.724
I guess I'm grateful that I'm still alive.

00:30:58.565 --> 00:30:59.858
So thank you.

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:35.101
TEIO PRISON

00:32:13.556 --> 00:32:19.062
{\an8}PUT ON A COLLAR AND GO UPSTAIRS
TO THE CENTRAL GUARDROOM

00:33:23.292 --> 00:33:25.837
Difficulty level,
Jack of Hearts.

00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:30.466
Game, Solitary Confinement.

00:33:31.467 --> 00:33:35.930
Rules. Guess the card suit
that appears on the back of your collar.

00:33:36.472 --> 00:33:40.309
However, you may not look
at the symbol yourself.

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:44.689
I can't see anything.

00:33:45.273 --> 00:33:48.192
The time limit is
one hour per round.

00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:53.990
In the final five minutes,
enter your cell and disclose your symbol.

00:34:11.257 --> 00:34:16.179
If you do not answer
with the correct symbol, it is game over.

00:34:16.262 --> 00:34:19.390
The collar will explode, and you will die.

00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:22.602
Additionally,
when the time limit reaches zero,

00:34:22.685 --> 00:34:26.481
the symbol on the collar will reset
and change for each round.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.903
Wait a sec. So that means we just have
to ask each other what our symbols are.

00:34:32.445 --> 00:34:33.738
That's easy, huh?

00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:35.364
I'm not so sure.

00:34:35.448 --> 00:34:38.451
They haven't told us
what the conditions to win are yet.

00:34:38.534 --> 00:34:40.328
The Solitary Confinement game

00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:43.539
is about how much
you can trust your fellow players.

00:34:43.623 --> 00:34:47.627
Be aware that your opponent,
the Jack of Hearts,

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.296
has already been placed among you.

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:53.049
Oh, that's good.

00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:56.886
So one of us

00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.722
is the Jack of Hearts?

00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:02.517
How to win.

00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:05.520
Rounds repeat every hour.

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:10.316
You win the game
when the Jack of Hearts dies.

00:35:13.694 --> 00:35:15.780
Prohibited actions.

00:35:15.863 --> 00:35:19.450
Looking at your symbol
with a reflective surface is cheating.

00:35:20.076 --> 00:35:24.664
Players may not use weapons or violence
to kill fellow players.

00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:29.127
This means
that the only way this game will ever end

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:32.130
is if the Jack gives the wrong answer.

00:35:33.005 --> 00:35:34.423
So, basically,

00:35:35.258 --> 00:35:38.970
no one here is getting out alive,
unless they lie to the Jack.

00:35:39.053 --> 00:35:41.806
There is no limit
to the number of rounds.

00:35:41.889 --> 00:35:43.266
There's no limit?

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:46.727
Enough food has been provided.

00:35:48.312 --> 00:35:49.272
What?

00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:00.283
While participating in this game,

00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:03.578
no days will be removed from your visas.

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:07.331
So we need to start lying,

00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:10.168
find the Jack of Hearts,
and kill them off,

00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:12.920
or we'll live out the rest of our days
in this prison.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.675
Solitary for life.

00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:20.887
The game will now commence.

00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:22.513
ROUND ONE

00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:26.142
You can roam freely
until it is time to enter your cell.

00:36:34.775 --> 00:36:36.319
Is this for real?

00:36:41.657 --> 00:36:42.491
Hey, man.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.495
Would you mind telling me
what my symbol is?

00:36:46.579 --> 00:36:48.080
And then I can tell you yours.

00:36:48.623 --> 00:36:49.582
Okay.

00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:53.586
So, the 20 of us
need to eliminate each other

00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:57.298
until we somehow figure out
who the Jack of Hearts is.

00:36:59.383 --> 00:37:01.761
What makes you think
that anyone is trustworthy?

00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:07.433
Do you wanna go downstairs?

00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:26.953
I have an idea.

00:37:27.036 --> 00:37:30.248
How about we get together
and make teams to tell each other?

00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:33.042
So that way, nobody can lie.

00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:34.210
Good idea.

00:37:34.293 --> 00:37:37.046
Um, would you mind
if I joined up with you?

00:37:37.129 --> 00:37:38.381
Me too?

00:37:38.464 --> 00:37:40.675
Excuse me. I'd like to join as well.

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:43.636
Sure! The more the merrier!

00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:44.887
Can I join too, please?

00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:47.598
Hey. I want you to tell me
what my symbol is.

00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:48.891
Um… Okay.

00:37:49.725 --> 00:37:51.978
Tell me what my symbol is, man.

00:37:52.895 --> 00:37:54.105
Go on.

00:37:54.188 --> 00:37:55.231
- Uh…
- Huh?

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:58.776
Why, can't you tell me?
Then I'll look at yours.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.236
Huh?

00:38:03.197 --> 00:38:04.949
Okay, now tell me mine.

00:38:05.032 --> 00:38:06.742
- All right.
- Come on.

00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:08.911
Hey, wanna tell each other the answer?

00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:12.331
If you're trying to survive,

00:38:12.415 --> 00:38:15.376
I would examine all the people here
a little more carefully.

00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:19.755
Make sure you keep
the ones who don't lie close.

00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:24.176
For all you know,
I'm the one who might be the Jack.

00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:27.847
You see?

00:38:28.347 --> 00:38:30.474
They all started breaking off into groups.

00:38:31.017 --> 00:38:34.478
Everyone wants to know
who's trustworthy and who's not.

00:38:38.399 --> 00:38:39.400
Take those two.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.153
Listen.

00:38:42.945 --> 00:38:44.280
If you wanna be safe…

00:38:44.363 --> 00:38:47.366
Before the game started,
you wanna know what they were doing?

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.045
What?

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:03.716
That guy wants to control everything
she does to exert power over her

00:39:04.717 --> 00:39:08.054
so that she can't interact
with any of the other players.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.474
Which is smart, in the long run.

00:39:11.557 --> 00:39:14.101
If you've got someone
you can trust that much,

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:15.853
that's how you can win the game.

00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:16.812
Hey.

00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:23.319
- Doesn't look like you have a partner yet.
- Hearts…

00:39:23.402 --> 00:39:25.738
Tell me what my symbol is,
and I'll tell you yours.

00:39:25.821 --> 00:39:27.698
- I don't know.
- Spades.

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:29.867
Clubs.

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:33.162
That's a pretty aggressive
attitude to take.

00:39:33.996 --> 00:39:34.830
Huh?

00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:38.834
That kind of childishness
makes you painfully transparent.

00:39:40.503 --> 00:39:44.298
You're ashamed of the darkness inside you,
which makes you petty and jealous.

00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:47.343
You try to keep yourself safe
behind those bangs.

00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:51.806
You hide your face so that
people won't see your ugly, empty soul.

00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:58.104
You're a pathetic excuse of a human being
who judges others to feel better.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.609
Pathetic and small.

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:06.070
But that's what I like about you.

00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:15.871
We should be friends.

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:29.009
Hey.

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:30.970
Do you wanna join our team?

00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:34.223
No pressure or anything.

00:40:34.807 --> 00:40:36.308
It's not that I don't want to.

00:40:37.017 --> 00:40:39.812
Okay. We'll join the group.

00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:43.774
- Do you wanna join us?
- Yes.

00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:45.359
Welcome to the group. Welcome.

00:40:47.653 --> 00:40:49.572
So I'm gonna go first, okay?

00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:52.658
I hope you'll all give me
the right answer.

00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:55.870
Oh, Urumi, yours is…

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:56.996
is a heart.

00:40:57.079 --> 00:40:58.247
- Heart.
- Heart. Heart.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:59.248
- Heart. Yes.
- Yeah.

00:41:00.916 --> 00:41:04.336
Okay, will you please do mine next?

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.463
Yours is a heart too.

00:41:05.546 --> 00:41:06.922
- Heart, yes.
- Heart.

00:41:07.006 --> 00:41:08.299
Heart.

00:41:08.382 --> 00:41:10.259
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll go next.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.305
- You're a spade.
- Yes. Spade.

00:41:14.388 --> 00:41:15.890
- It's a spade.
- See, it's a spade.

00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:18.184
- Uh, may I go next?
- Sure. Yeah.

00:41:18.767 --> 00:41:19.727
- Diamond.
- Diamond?

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.437
- Yes, yes, diamond.
- It's a diamond.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.646
Yes, a diamond.

00:41:24.023 --> 00:41:25.774
Yes. Diamond. Diamond.

00:41:25.858 --> 00:41:26.817
- That's it.
- Mm-hmm.

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.653
- Club.
- You're a club. That's it.

00:41:29.737 --> 00:41:31.489
- A club, yes. It's a club.
- Club, yes.

00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:33.449
Oh, okay, I'll go next.

00:41:34.575 --> 00:41:37.369
It is time to give your answer.

00:41:37.453 --> 00:41:42.166
Please enter a solitary confinement cell
of your choosing.

00:41:58.307 --> 00:42:00.559
Please give your answer.

00:42:02.102 --> 00:42:03.062
Diamond.

00:42:28.837 --> 00:42:29.838
Wow.

00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:32.424
That was so easy.

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:42.810
- Ah, thank goodness!
- Let's do this every round.

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:43.978
Yes.

00:42:44.436 --> 00:42:46.522
Oh my gosh. I'm so relieved.

00:42:46.605 --> 00:42:47.856
Thank goodness.

00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:51.902
Round two begins now.

00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:00.869
- Thank you so much. Let's do that again.
- Yes, thank you so much.

00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:04.373
- Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.
- Yes, thank you.

00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:05.666
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:09.086
- An answer!
- Thanks everyone, for being honest.

00:43:09.169 --> 00:43:10.421
I feel very relieved.

00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:13.882
I keep wondering
how long this is going to go on for.

00:43:15.217 --> 00:43:17.761
Either the Jack will start to kill,

00:43:17.845 --> 00:43:20.931
or someone who's afraid of the Jack
will start to kill.

00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:22.016
…stick together…

00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:26.186
Until either or both of those things
happen, this will never end.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.855
Exactly.

00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:33.319
As long as we keep being honest
with each other, we'll be all right.

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:35.487
Or not.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.573
What the fuck?

00:43:39.825 --> 00:43:42.870
I told you to give me the answer!

00:43:48.375 --> 00:43:49.710
You all right?

00:43:53.213 --> 00:43:54.715
Tell him he's a club.

00:44:03.932 --> 00:44:06.018
Looks to me
like you want another beating.

00:44:06.101 --> 00:44:07.770
Huh?

00:44:08.562 --> 00:44:10.105
Huh?

00:44:10.189 --> 00:44:11.065
Huh?

00:44:15.444 --> 00:44:16.695
Give me the answer!

00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:19.198
C-- Club.

00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:21.700
- Huh?
- Club!

00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:32.670
Don't wait so long next time.

00:44:45.557 --> 00:44:46.809
Shh!

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.729
Now the game is really starting.

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.498
Are you all right?

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:11.917
Yeah.

00:45:12.584 --> 00:45:15.337
How would you like to join up
with our group instead?

00:45:18.799 --> 00:45:19.883
Thank you.

00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:35.149
It is time to give your answer.

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:39.570
Please enter a solitary confinement cell
of your choosing.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.384
Please give your answer.

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:05.429
The answer's club.

00:46:18.192 --> 00:46:19.151
{\an8}GENKI KIRIU

00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:22.905
Oh, I can't believe it.

00:46:22.988 --> 00:46:24.198
I know him.

00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:26.533
- I'm so scared.
- That bully.

00:46:27.493 --> 00:46:30.454
- I wonder who's gonna be next.
- Okay, great.

00:46:31.413 --> 00:46:34.583
- Do you think it could be me?
- What? I don't get it.

00:46:34.666 --> 00:46:35.876
I don't know.

00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:37.544
He hit that guy.

00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:39.588
Lo-- look. Someone's missing.

00:46:40.088 --> 00:46:42.090
- That big dumb guy, right?
- Is that right?

00:46:42.174 --> 00:46:43.509
Yes, yes, it was him, yes.

00:46:44.092 --> 00:46:46.261
- Remember, we're a team.
- Yeah.

00:46:47.763 --> 00:46:49.473
If we keep
telling the truth, then…

00:46:49.556 --> 00:46:51.141
- It was me.
- …everyone will be okay.

00:46:51.225 --> 00:46:52.184
Hey.

00:46:52.267 --> 00:46:54.144
…what his suit was, that's all…

00:46:54.228 --> 00:46:56.688
That guy must be the Jack.

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:58.524
Yeah, I know.

00:46:58.607 --> 00:47:02.319
- He lied to that big bully and killed him.
- Someone has to…

00:47:03.195 --> 00:47:05.739
- Okay, we stay together.
- I don't know who to trust.

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:09.076
I think we'd better kill him next turn.

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:10.828
- What do you think?
- What?

00:47:12.454 --> 00:47:14.248
- You tell me…
- Are you saying…

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:17.793
- …trust each other…
- …we should lie to him?

00:47:17.876 --> 00:47:19.962
- How are we supposed to know?
- What…

00:47:20.045 --> 00:47:21.338
Of course.

00:47:21.922 --> 00:47:24.091
He's definitely the Jack.

00:47:24.591 --> 00:47:26.552
And if not, he's still dangerous.

00:47:27.219 --> 00:47:30.138
We should eliminate him
while we have the chance.

00:47:54.162 --> 00:47:55.789
Next up is, uh…

00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:57.207
You!

00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:59.126
Okay, great.

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:00.878
Oh, you're a heart.

00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:02.421
- Yeah, a heart.
- Yes. Heart.

00:48:02.504 --> 00:48:04.381
- Yes, that's a heart.
- Heart. Heart.

00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:07.342
- May I go next?
- Yes, yes, please.

00:48:08.969 --> 00:48:10.429
Your symbol is a diamond.

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.931
- Diamond, yes.
- Diamond.

00:48:13.015 --> 00:48:14.766
- That's a diamond.
- It's a diamond.

00:48:15.517 --> 00:48:16.852
Can you do mine next?

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:21.523
Looks like your symbol's a spade.

00:48:22.983 --> 00:48:24.318
- Uh, yes.
- Mm-hmm.

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:25.569
- Spade. Spade.
- Yes.

00:48:25.652 --> 00:48:26.862
- It's a spade.
- Spade.

00:48:26.945 --> 00:48:29.114
- Spade.
- Thank you very much.

00:48:35.203 --> 00:48:36.246
- Uh…
- Hm…

00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:40.834
Uh…

00:49:00.062 --> 00:49:02.439
Please give your answer.

00:49:04.733 --> 00:49:05.901
It's a spade.

00:49:09.696 --> 00:49:10.572
{\an8}AKIFUMI SETO

00:49:14.159 --> 00:49:17.412
Round four begins now.

00:49:17.996 --> 00:49:19.915
What? I don't get it.

00:49:20.874 --> 00:49:23.335
I guess that guy
wasn't the Jack of Hearts.

00:49:27.214 --> 00:49:28.840
See? Told you this would happen.

00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:32.344
People are starting to get nervous.

00:49:32.427 --> 00:49:34.513
I know they said there was no time limit…

00:49:36.223 --> 00:49:39.017
except that people
are actually starting to die now.

00:49:40.227 --> 00:49:42.312
I'm not sure we'll find the Jack at all.

00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:18.015
That girl there,

00:50:18.098 --> 00:50:21.977
she wasn't on our side when we tried
to get our stories straight earlier.

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:25.230
Should we kill her? Hmm?

00:50:37.242 --> 00:50:38.618
Please, do mine.

00:50:40.162 --> 00:50:41.329
Oh, uh… Diamond.

00:50:41.413 --> 00:50:44.458
- Yes. Diamond.
- Diamond. Diamond. It is.

00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:49.463
All right, will you do mine next, please?

00:50:53.133 --> 00:50:55.093
It looks like your symbol is

00:50:55.677 --> 00:50:56.887
a club!

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:58.638
Yes, yes.

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.807
- It's club.
- Club.

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.726
- Yes, club. Club, it is.
- Yes.

00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:04.644
It's a club.

00:51:06.021 --> 00:51:07.564
Thank you very much.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.616
Please give your answer.

00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:22.412
Spade.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.671
{\an8}MEISA TOKUI

00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:38.011
- You're a spade.
- Spade. Spade.

00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:39.513
Thank you so much.

00:51:40.347 --> 00:51:41.932
Do mine next, please.

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:44.184
- It's a club.
- Oh yeah.

00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:46.186
- Yes, it's a club.
- Club. Club.

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:48.563
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you think she…

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.691
Your symbol is

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:53.193
a heart!

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:54.402
- Heart, yes.
- Mm-hm.

00:51:54.486 --> 00:51:56.404
- Yes. Heart.
- Heart it is, yes.

00:51:56.488 --> 00:51:58.490
Will you do mine now?

00:52:03.328 --> 00:52:04.830
You're a spade.

00:52:04.913 --> 00:52:06.915
- Yes.
- Spade. Spade.

00:52:06.998 --> 00:52:09.167
- Yes, spade.
- Thank you.

00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:15.048
Um,

00:52:16.383 --> 00:52:17.300
excuse me.

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:19.886
Excuse me.

00:52:22.013 --> 00:52:23.306
Would you mind

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:26.017
telling me what my symbol is, please?

00:52:28.562 --> 00:52:30.730
I don't think my group is being honest.

00:52:34.526 --> 00:52:35.485
Okay.

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:38.238
Thank you very much.

00:52:39.447 --> 00:52:40.490
Here.

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:47.497
It's a club.

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:49.624
Club?

00:52:51.459 --> 00:52:52.419
Club!

00:52:54.588 --> 00:52:55.672
Club!

00:52:56.923 --> 00:52:59.926
Thank you very much. Thank you very much!

00:53:00.427 --> 00:53:02.095
Club.

00:53:07.184 --> 00:53:08.602
Can't be too careful, right?

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.034
Please give your answer.

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:29.122
Club.

00:53:39.174 --> 00:53:40.175
SHINOBU FURUTA

00:53:41.301 --> 00:53:44.512
Round six begins now.

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:51.144
Why are they all tricking each other?

00:53:52.145 --> 00:53:54.022
Wow, are you really surprised?

00:53:55.023 --> 00:53:57.275
Nobody wants to be the next to die.

00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:28.348
Round nine begins now.

00:54:30.016 --> 00:54:31.101
I can't…

00:54:31.184 --> 00:54:32.644
I can't take it.

00:54:33.353 --> 00:54:34.604
I'm gonna throw up.

00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:37.857
Keep it together!

00:54:38.358 --> 00:54:40.986
You're a club.

00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:43.238
Okay, you tell me mine.

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:46.616
Uh, diam--

00:54:48.201 --> 00:54:49.536
Uh…

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:51.288
Dia…

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.290
You're a heart.

00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:55.625
Heart.

00:54:55.709 --> 00:54:57.252
- It's a heart.
- Heart.

00:55:14.519 --> 00:55:16.563
Let's eliminate him now.

00:55:17.105 --> 00:55:18.440
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:55:18.523 --> 00:55:20.942
He was thinking about tricking me.

00:55:21.901 --> 00:55:24.529
It seems he has a problem with how I work.

00:55:24.612 --> 00:55:25.613
But…

00:55:26.239 --> 00:55:29.784
If we don't get rid of him right away,
we'll all be in danger.

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.249
Round nine is almost over.

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:40.545
I think we should
eliminate her, now.

00:55:43.923 --> 00:55:46.009
We're all in danger because of her.

00:55:46.885 --> 00:55:49.804
We can't keep letting that psycho

00:55:50.388 --> 00:55:52.557
do whatever she wants to us.

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:10.533
- This, uh… This is for you.
- Oh.

00:56:10.617 --> 00:56:11.910
Um, here's something to drink.

00:56:11.993 --> 00:56:13.495
What else did you bring me?

00:56:13.578 --> 00:56:15.413
And some crackers too.

00:56:17.457 --> 00:56:19.501
Oh, you have no taste.

00:56:19.584 --> 00:56:22.087
I have cookies.
Would you like a cookie?

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:23.630
I hate cookies.

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:25.715
I think we should kill them both.

00:56:25.799 --> 00:56:27.050
I hate chocolate.

00:56:27.133 --> 00:56:28.385
What do you say?

00:56:28.468 --> 00:56:30.845
What else would you like?

00:56:56.704 --> 00:56:58.540
You're a spade.

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:01.000
Diamond.

00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:03.920
Diamond.

00:57:04.504 --> 00:57:05.755
It's spade.

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:07.841
Diamond.

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:10.468
Thanks, guys.

00:57:10.552 --> 00:57:13.054
You're the only people I can trust now!

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.231
Please give your answer.

00:57:28.403 --> 00:57:29.362
Diamond.

00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:30.572
Spade!

00:57:40.498 --> 00:57:41.708
{\an8}URUMI AKAMAKI

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:42.625
{\an8}MOTOHIKO KANEKO

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:53.178
Spade.

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:56.389
Club.

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:08.735
They all fell
for the Jack of Hearts' trap.

00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:14.115
Once team members start killing
each other, the trust is broken,

00:58:14.199 --> 00:58:15.950
and the group is destroyed.

00:58:18.536 --> 00:58:20.914
Well, I don't think
that we have that problem.

00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:22.415
Right.

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:25.627
You don't need to worry about that.

00:58:26.544 --> 00:58:28.129
Not while I'm protecting you.

00:58:31.382 --> 00:58:32.967
Thank you, master.

00:58:46.356 --> 00:58:48.608
I don't think I can keep
playing this game.

00:58:51.236 --> 00:58:52.320
Diamond.

00:58:59.577 --> 00:59:01.037
How much longer, man?

00:59:07.835 --> 00:59:09.546
It's so messed up.

00:59:14.759 --> 00:59:15.885
I thought that…

00:59:17.637 --> 00:59:19.556
people were much better than this.

00:59:22.433 --> 00:59:24.310
Man, you led a charmed life.

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:28.481
I'm sorry.

00:59:29.732 --> 00:59:31.609
But this is our reality now.

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:34.362
Maybe we won't get out of this alive.

00:59:35.947 --> 00:59:40.451
But even so, all we can do for now
is help each other

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:43.746
so that we can get out of this game.

00:59:50.295 --> 00:59:51.129
Okay?

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:53.047
We can do this.

00:59:58.136 --> 00:59:59.178
Okay.

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:02.098
What's my symbol?

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.026
Heart.

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:32.712
I can't do it.

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:39.177
I can't.

01:00:40.928 --> 01:00:42.305
I can't do this.

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:45.975
Please give your answer.

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.531
I won't do this.

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:07.080
{\an8}IPPEI OKI

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:22.011
You were too kind for this world, Ippei.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.726
Well, that's settled.

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:31.562
Seems I've lost my partner.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.791
Looks like I'm screwed.
