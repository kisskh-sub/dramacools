00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:52.552
Focus on what you're doing, Yuzuha!

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.113
It's okay, Dad.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:22.499
I'm gonna survive.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.925
SHIBUYA STATION

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.698
What?

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.027
How did it go?

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.737
Not good. Ugh, I got nothing.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:03:59.614
All right.

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:02.742
Let's just grab anything
that might be useful.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.881
FURNITURE AND INTERIOR GOODS FLOOR

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.508
Just as I thought,

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.802
all the IC chips have been destroyed.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.306
Video cameras, digital clocks.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.268
Anything that operates
with an electronic circuit board

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:29.602
isn't gonna work.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:34.274
But old stuff like this still works,

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:37.277
since none of it has any IC chips.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.281
What does that mean?

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.867
It might mean…

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:46.869
Hurry!

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.746
Look, fireworks!

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.753
An electromagnetic pulse attack.

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.507
I read about this online.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.551
When inserted into the stratosphere,

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:05.680
it's a weapon capable of destroying
the electronics in an entire city.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.057
Seriously?

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:16.399
So… why is this working?

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.028
No idea.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.448
VISA
RYOHEI ARISU

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:24.449
REMAINING DAYS: 3

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.284
Hey!

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:41.174
It's completely useless
if we can't charge it.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.806
This place looks safe enough.

00:05:57.648 --> 00:05:59.734
All right. This might be a good weapon.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.237
What do you need a weapon for?

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.532
Zombies.

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:13.873
You know you can't use
electricity or gas, right?

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.292
But I can still use the portable stove.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.669
It has batteries
that I can also use in my flashlight.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.505
And I like a hot meal sometimes.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:22.924
Hmm.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.614
This is so good!

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.575
Ah, nice and hot!

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.702
We haven't eaten anything
since yesterday.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:57.125
Hey, what were you guys doing

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.751
when everyone disappeared?

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.004
Bathroom.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.465
We were all in the same stall.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.884
Why were you all in the same stall?

00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:08.386
Where were you?

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:14.767
Saori…

00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:25.153
I was at work.

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.323
I was in the conference room
doing some paperwork.

00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:31.159
And then,

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.744
everyone in the office disappeared.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.457
Did you happen to see or hear
anything at all?

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:57.810
Boss?

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.037
Not really.

00:08:17.788 --> 00:08:19.582
I came to this place three days ago,

00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:24.212
and I was forced to play this game,
just like all of you were.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.424
Everybody died, except for me.

00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:32.845
You mean, you used them as bait, right?

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.514
Think whatever you want.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.350
All I wanted…

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:40.436
was to survive.

00:08:51.572 --> 00:08:52.740
Well…

00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:01.874
What kind of game was it?

00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:06.796
It was at the subway.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.883
They used poisonous gas in the game.

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:15.137
Everyone was vomiting blood.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.516
Blood was coming out of their eyes.

00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:24.355
Weird, huh?

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.150
The day everyone disappeared.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.902
It was yesterday for the three of us.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:30.987
Yeah.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.030
But it was three days ago for her.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:34.365
Why the time difference?

00:09:35.032 --> 00:09:35.866
That's right.

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:38.244
And those vegetables that were rotten…

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:41.080
They take longer than a few days
to go bad.

00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:43.207
What's going on?

00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:47.086
Maybe the speed of time is…

00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:49.088
different from the normal world?

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:50.631
Huh?

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.175
I don't really know, but…

00:09:53.884 --> 00:09:56.596
Take the, the four of us here.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:10:01.309
The timeline of when people disappeared
is different, like you said.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:07.940
Did we time travel while we were
in the subway bathroom stall?

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.525
There's no way.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.485
There's also no way
people just disappeared.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:12.778
Time travel isn't real.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.614
Then explain the game
and people disappearing.

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.115
I don't know, all right?

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:17.491
Anyways,

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:20.119
one thing we know for sure
about this game…

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.664
A game master's running it.

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:25.458
Game master?

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.918
Someone came up with this game.

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:29.837
That's for sure.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.799
So while we're in a bathroom stall,

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.218
they get rid of everyone in Tokyo

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.762
and set up this game?

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:39.305
They keep track of our movements…

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.893
…and fire lasers through our heads
when we make the wrong move.

00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:47.688
What kind of person would do that?

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.483
I don't know, but it's definitely possible

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:52.860
if they inserted
a highly accurate GPS microchip

00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:54.028
into our bodies.

00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:56.656
Spoken like a real IT geek.

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.867
But who the hell could be
behind this thing?

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.160
Hmm.

00:11:01.243 --> 00:11:02.453
Could it be…

00:11:02.953 --> 00:11:06.040
some government-run experiment
or something?

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:10.878
There were some rumors
going around at my work.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.632
An IT company from Europe wanted
to conduct an experiment.

00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:16.509
They'd established a VR space,

00:11:16.592 --> 00:11:19.720
then created an alternate world
identical to the real one.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.768
But we should be able to tell VR
from the real world.

00:11:26.977 --> 00:11:28.479
Man…

00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:29.939
This hurts.

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:33.442
I don't think
VR can cause burns like that.

00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:38.114
Maybe it's God.

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:40.533
This has to be the work of God.

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:42.743
Otherwise, how else do you explain it?

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.829
You're talking crazy now.

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:46.997
No, man. I think…

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.333
God really does exist.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.215
Hey, is it getting worse?

00:11:58.634 --> 00:11:59.885
It's all right.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.011
Oh, it's gonna be fine.

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.938
I think we gotta get Chota
to a doctor.

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.692
You know how he is.

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:17.194
It's probably hurting more than he says.

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:18.696
But it's getting to him.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.409
Arisu.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.538
Let's get in the game tomorrow night,

00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:28.706
just you and me.

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:30.624
What?

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.836
But we've got three days left
on our visas.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.841
It's better to get in the game
while we still have time.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:41.802
I just don't think

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:45.598
Chota's gonna be able to make it through.
He's in too much pain.

00:12:52.813 --> 00:12:54.023
How are you doing?

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:56.150
Not bad, thanks.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.571
If the two of us don't figure out
how to get through this game,

00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:02.281
we won't be able to protect Chota.

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:05.159
You're right, but…

00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:08.204
Maybe we can find a doctor too.

00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:10.498
We'll meet more people if we're playing.

00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:14.460
Do we really have to play again?

00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:17.129
Maybe we'll get an idea
what this game's about.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:23.969
Yeah, I guess.

00:13:25.012 --> 00:13:26.138
If we play,

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.015
we might find out their signature.

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:31.101
Signature?

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.104
Yeah. If someone actually created
this game,

00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:39.068
there's a kind of signature they use,
like formatting.

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.111
If we can discover that,

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.989
we might be able to figure out
a strategy for the game.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:09.431
{\an8}TOEI SENDAGAYA APARTMENT

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:40.296
1 PER PERSON

00:14:41.088 --> 00:14:43.549
{\an8}FACE RECOGNITION IN PROGRESS
PLEASE WAIT FOR A MOMENT

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:46.427
Please wait until the game commences.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.929
There are currently ten participants.

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:51.682
One minute until registration closes.

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:54.977
Um, excuse me.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.272
Wha-- Where did all the people
in Tokyo go?

00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:04.820
This thing here--

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.573
There's a lot of people here.
Maybe one's a doctor.

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:15.372
1 PER PERSON

00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:46.236
Registration has closed.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:52.076
There are a total of 13 participants.
The game will now commence.

00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:54.453
E-- Excuse me.

00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:57.164
What is this? I was brought here.

00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:59.875
And I… I don't know what's going on.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.878
- It's a game.
- Shut up.

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:05.422
Newbies will slow us down.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.716
They might hate us,

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:11.011
but I think it'd be a good idea
to do what Shibuki did.

00:16:13.597 --> 00:16:16.600
Difficulty, Five of Spades.

00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:22.064
Five of Spades?

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.441
It's gonna be physical.

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:26.151
Only the strong survive.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.237
I'm Nitobe. Nice to meet you.

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:31.448
The suit means something?

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:32.992
Exactly.

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:37.162
The suit of the playing card usually means
what kind of game it's gonna be.

00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:40.791
Clubs is a team battle.
Diamonds is your wits.

00:16:40.874 --> 00:16:42.001
And as for Hearts…

00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:45.170
That's the worst one.

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:47.089
- Why is that?
- Huh?

00:16:48.048 --> 00:16:50.801
Because you're playing
with people's hearts then tear them apart.

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:55.139
And the number?

00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:56.682
Difficulty.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.561
The higher the number on the card,

00:17:00.644 --> 00:17:01.895
the harder it is.

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:06.525
Game is "Tag".

00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:11.196
Rule. Avoid whoever is "it".

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.698
What?

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:20.205
- So who's "it"?
- How should I know?

00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:22.207
Clear condition.

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.334
{\an8}Discover and touch the symbol

00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:27.963
{\an8}hidden in one of the building's rooms
within the time limit.

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:31.050
{\an8}You clear the game
when this objective is fulfilled.

00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:32.801
{\an8}Time limit, 20 minutes.

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:35.429
After 20 minutes,

00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:39.183
the time bomb hidden
in the building will explode.

00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:57.534
TOEI SENDAGAYA APARTMENT

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.711
O Holy Mother.

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:11.465
Please forgive us
for all of our mortal sins.

00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:14.843
Our smiles are the light of hope.

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:18.305
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.311
O Holy Mother.
Please forgive us for all our mortal sins.

00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.773
Our smiles are the light of hope.

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:30.776
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:33.237
So you believe in God.

00:18:38.325 --> 00:18:39.159
Here.

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:44.081
I've also been doing nothing
but praying recently.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:47.000
I don't believe in God.

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:51.255
But my mother was obsessed
with some cult for a while.

00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:52.381
Hmm.

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:56.301
Because of that, I was bullied in school.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:58.887
But Arisu and Karube saved me.

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:02.724
They are good friends, aren't they?

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.063
Karube is good at fighting
and the girls really love him,

00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:12.693
and Arisu is so smart
and comes from a respected family.

00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:14.862
Then there's me.

00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:18.031
My family's poor,
and I'm not really good at anything.

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:23.287
Even now, when I'm hurt and useless,
they're still helping me.

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:26.707
Some people…

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:30.043
like being the strongest ones
in their group.

00:19:31.086 --> 00:19:32.546
It makes them feel better.

00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:35.465
They're just so different.

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:38.260
Think you might feel good enough
to play the next game?

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.015
How does your leg feel?

00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:47.853
They're just so different.

00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:51.356
Are you willing to die too,
to save your friends?

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:03.535
The game will commence in two minutes.

00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:05.829
Stop following us.

00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:08.290
Just feeling you guys out.

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:10.626
I'm thinking you two might be
good enough to be my allies.

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:11.960
Lucky ass.

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.421
- Are you a doctor?
- Nope, real estate agent.

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:17.049
How many times have you played the game?

00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:19.593
Uh… Let's see, maybe five times?

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:21.553
And you've always won?

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.388
I guess so, yeah.

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:26.266
Where should I go to hide?

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.726
Look, I don't know, all right?

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:29.978
You can only rely on yourself.

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.664
If I wanna see where everyone is,

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.999
this is the perfect location.

00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:06.848
Yeah.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.976
I got a weird feeling about this.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:17.901
Hmm…

00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:21.947
Looks like everyone's about to bite it,
just like they always do.

00:21:23.907 --> 00:21:27.286
I think, maybe
you've always been screwed over, Shibuki.

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:29.496
You've never met anyone decent.

00:21:31.581 --> 00:21:32.833
You're right.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.173
Isn't it the same way for you?

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:46.847
O Holy Mother…

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:51.101
Please forgive us for all our mortal sins.

00:21:58.066 --> 00:21:59.276
No, you're wrong.

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:14.249
It must have been rough.

00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:41.651
The game will now commence.

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:45.739
The time limit is 20 minutes.

00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:47.949
Commence now.

00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:54.915
The tagger is on the move.

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:49.488
All right,
let's find a room we can get into.

00:24:58.872 --> 00:25:01.458
We gotta get our asses moving!

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:23.104
Three minutes have passed.

00:25:39.162 --> 00:25:40.539
What the hell was that?

00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:09.359
He's dead.

00:26:36.803 --> 00:26:39.055
Arisu!

00:26:40.056 --> 00:26:41.641
- Run!
- Go, go!

00:26:43.059 --> 00:26:43.893
Arisu!

00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:44.811
- Run!
- Outta the way!

00:26:44.894 --> 00:26:45.937
- Go down!
- Hurry!

00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:47.022
Go, go, go!

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:49.691
Don't look back! Go!

00:26:50.483 --> 00:26:51.943
Move, move!

00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:54.195
What are you doing? Hey!

00:26:54.904 --> 00:26:56.323
Karube, wait!

00:26:57.032 --> 00:26:58.408
What are you doing?

00:26:59.159 --> 00:27:00.243
Get in there.

00:27:18.428 --> 00:27:20.180
You're a good person, Chota…

00:27:20.847 --> 00:27:22.265
I can trust you, can't I?

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:38.406
When this started,

00:27:39.949 --> 00:27:41.910
I was having sex with my boss.

00:27:45.205 --> 00:27:46.539
And I hated it.

00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:50.835
I thought you said you were working.

00:27:52.253 --> 00:27:53.922
I don't trust those guys.

00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:56.800
They didn't need to know the truth,
did they?

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.657
Since we're both the same,

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:22.867
we should work together.

00:28:47.142 --> 00:28:48.601
So we can survive…

00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:03.032
Oh, my god!

00:29:03.116 --> 00:29:05.410
I can't do this. I can't do this!

00:29:51.748 --> 00:29:53.875
Hurry up, Mai!

00:29:57.754 --> 00:29:59.380
- Aya!
- Get up!

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.926
Aya!

00:30:07.263 --> 00:30:09.224
I swear to God I'll kill you!

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:11.518
Get away from me!

00:30:21.903 --> 00:30:24.364
I told you the truth
because I trust you, Chota.

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:38.628
O Holy Mother…

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.756
Holy Mother…

00:30:43.299 --> 00:30:45.468
O Holy Mother…

00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:48.137
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:50.932
O Holy Mother…

00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:54.185
- Please forgive us for…
- Wait for me, okay?

00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:55.979
…our mortal sins.

00:30:57.063 --> 00:30:59.691
Our smiles are the light of hope.

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:02.944
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

00:31:04.112 --> 00:31:05.738
O Holy Mother…

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:10.285
Please forgive us for our mortal sins.

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:12.036
Please accept this.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.581
Our smiles are the light of hope.

00:31:15.498 --> 00:31:18.001
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:20.962
Very well, this way.

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:25.091
O Holy Mother, please forgive us…

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:29.220
The Holy Mother will appear when we smile.

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:32.599
Our smiles are the light of hope.

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:39.188
O Holy Mother,
please forgive us for our mortal sins.

00:31:39.272 --> 00:31:41.649
- Come on, let's go.
- We'll all go together.

00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:43.526
O Holy Mother,

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.404
please forgive us for…

00:31:46.487 --> 00:31:49.115
…all our mortal sins.

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:52.744
…all our mortal sins.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.333
O Holy Mother.

00:32:01.628 --> 00:32:02.712
Please.

00:32:03.504 --> 00:32:04.923
Save them.

00:32:08.134 --> 00:32:09.802
What are we gonna do, man?

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.722
If you've got a solution, now's the time.

00:32:12.805 --> 00:32:13.640
I don't know what to do

00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:15.600
against something like that.

00:32:15.683 --> 00:32:18.519
- Come on, man. Think.
- Why don't you think of something?

00:32:38.414 --> 00:32:39.999
He didn't see us.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.294
His vision is narrowed
because of the mask.

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:45.672
That's his weak point.

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:48.007
This might be a way
to get through the game.

00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:54.973
- Everyone! He's up here!
- Hey!

00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:57.016
Over here, he's on the second level!

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.977
- You'll get us killed!
- He can't see properly

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.269
because of his mask!

00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:02.355
Tell us where he is if you see him,

00:33:02.438 --> 00:33:04.232
and let's all look for the symbol!

00:33:07.276 --> 00:33:08.778
That's a good idea, but…

00:33:09.737 --> 00:33:11.447
nobody wants to help.

00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:18.997
He's in the fourth-level hallway
in the central building!

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.790
Anyone there should get out!

00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:23.418
Really?

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:27.839
- Hurry, get out of here!
- What?

00:33:28.423 --> 00:33:29.716
I'm sorry.

00:33:33.428 --> 00:33:34.303
Oh, ho.

00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:37.056
A climber?

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:38.808
She's not bad.

00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:40.768
{\an8}TOEI SENDAGAYA APARTMENT

00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:44.480
{\an8}The game is over in eight minutes.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.943
There are currently seven survivors.

00:34:32.695 --> 00:34:34.530
Hey! Yo!

00:34:35.114 --> 00:34:37.325
Over here! Hey!

00:34:44.707 --> 00:34:46.417
Leave him! We gotta get outta here!

00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:48.795
Come on, man. You can't stay here.

00:34:48.878 --> 00:34:50.046
Move!

00:34:52.799 --> 00:34:53.883
Hurry up!

00:35:05.561 --> 00:35:06.813
And here we go.

00:35:12.902 --> 00:35:13.903
Arisu!

00:35:14.737 --> 00:35:16.197
Hurry!

00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:18.282
Hurry.

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:20.618
This guy's going down now.

00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:23.121
What? But he's got a machine gun.

00:35:23.204 --> 00:35:25.289
So? The tagger's human.

00:35:28.918 --> 00:35:31.921
He's 190 centimeters tall
and weighs 90 kilos,

00:35:32.004 --> 00:35:33.256
and he's right-handed.

00:35:33.339 --> 00:35:35.424
He's a pretty good shot, too.

00:35:35.508 --> 00:35:38.261
Probably military or law enforcement.

00:35:38.344 --> 00:35:39.595
Aguni!

00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:41.472
Here it is.

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:49.856
Use this.

00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:57.488
Let's get this guy.

00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:02.994
You, go look for the symbol.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:04.954
What?

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.291
Hey! Why should we do what you say?

00:36:08.374 --> 00:36:09.458
I got it.

00:36:09.542 --> 00:36:10.543
I'll go up to the top.

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:12.920
Arisu!

00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:14.589
I don't like this.

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:16.215
There's no other choice.

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:17.967
I checked
the south side of the fifth floor,

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:19.844
and the south and east side
of the sixth floor.

00:36:19.927 --> 00:36:22.263
Let's split up and find the symbol.

00:36:23.222 --> 00:36:24.974
I didn't check
the first and second floors.

00:36:25.057 --> 00:36:27.602
All right. I'll go check.

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.187
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:36:35.776 --> 00:36:37.904
It's time to take this guy out.

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:45.786
Five minutes remaining in the game.

00:36:47.747 --> 00:36:48.748
See you later.

00:36:49.832 --> 00:36:50.833
Yeah.

00:37:07.934 --> 00:37:09.894
Where the hell is that symbol?

00:37:15.107 --> 00:37:17.860
Calm down. Relax and think.

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:26.744
Come on, follow me.

00:37:28.871 --> 00:37:30.915
He's using a MAC-10.

00:37:30.998 --> 00:37:33.960
He can go through a 32-round clip
in 1.5 seconds.

00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:37.797
We'll take him when he's reloading.

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:47.223
I'm right here!

00:37:50.559 --> 00:37:52.728
That's right. Come on!

00:38:01.862 --> 00:38:02.905
Aguni?

00:38:05.491 --> 00:38:06.367
Aguni?

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.160
Aguni!

00:38:12.832 --> 00:38:14.000
Son of a bitch.

00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:41.379
Come on.

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:43.172
Think, dammit.

00:40:02.691 --> 00:40:05.778
Why would he shoot from so far away?

00:40:21.127 --> 00:40:22.420
Figured it out too, huh?

00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:25.798
Yeah, the symbol's in here.

00:40:34.557 --> 00:40:35.891
Gonna open it?

00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:39.019
Why was he chasing us?

00:40:40.187 --> 00:40:41.689
He could've just waited.

00:40:43.482 --> 00:40:45.317
Guess there's something we don't know.

00:40:47.987 --> 00:40:48.821
Except,

00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:50.364
not much time left.

00:40:56.495 --> 00:40:59.165
Three minutes remaining in the game.

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:49.840
Look out!

00:42:01.393 --> 00:42:02.811
It never hurts to be prepared--

00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:25.209
{\an8}PUSH BOTH BUTTONS
AT ONCE TO CLEAR GAME

00:42:25.292 --> 00:42:26.210
Damn it!

00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:33.092
Someone get over here!

00:42:33.175 --> 00:42:36.679
The symbol's up here! Room 406!

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:39.807
I can't clear the game alone!

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.059
We need two people to do it!

00:42:42.142 --> 00:42:44.186
Seriously?

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.355
Arisu!

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:13.173
Now we're having fun, aren't we?

00:43:23.726 --> 00:43:26.562
One minute remaining in the game.

00:43:44.246 --> 00:43:45.831
Someone!

00:43:45.914 --> 00:43:47.374
Help me!

00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:04.683
30 seconds remaining in the game.

00:44:17.738 --> 00:44:19.657
20 seconds.

00:44:31.251 --> 00:44:32.086
You called?

00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:33.337
Ten seconds.

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:36.423
Here!

00:44:43.263 --> 00:44:44.348
Five.

00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:45.683
- Four.
- The buttons!

00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:46.975
Three.

00:44:47.059 --> 00:44:49.103
Two. One.

00:44:53.482 --> 00:44:55.234
EMERGENCY BUTTON
STOP

00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:06.203
Game cleared. Congratulations.

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:35.649
Oh, no.

00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:18.567
So this guy…

00:46:19.735 --> 00:46:21.820
had no choice but to play the game?

00:46:30.746 --> 00:46:32.748
Are you there? Over.

00:46:34.374 --> 00:46:35.959
Do you copy?

00:46:36.752 --> 00:46:38.420
Repeat. Are you there?

00:46:42.591 --> 00:46:44.802
Please respond. Over.

00:46:49.348 --> 00:46:52.684
Do you copy?
Answer. Over. Do you read?

00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:54.186
…it's in our hands now.

00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:56.980
"Answer"?

00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:00.567
Hey, can you hear me?

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.238
Hey, what "answer"?

00:47:06.448 --> 00:47:07.699
Come back.

00:47:07.783 --> 00:47:10.577
The answer is in our hands now.

00:47:11.745 --> 00:47:13.789
Get back to the Beach.

00:47:15.123 --> 00:47:16.291
"The Beach"?

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.098
Get back.

00:47:31.974 --> 00:47:33.976
Get back to the Beach.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:37.896
Get back to the Beach!
