MARCH 3, 2027
THE 23RD PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:08.693
THE 23RD PRESIDENT-ELECT
HYUN MIN-CHEOL ACCEPTANCE SPEECH

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:13.615
No.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:17.494
How could you say that
at this crucial moment?

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:20.914
If not now…

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.634
If this isn't a crucial moment,
is it okay?

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.559
Imagine what people will say

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.728
if you get divorced
right after being elected.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.231
You think the media will just keep quiet?

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:49.818
Your approval rating
could be cut in half in no time.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.280
Remember what you said after the election?

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:57.492
You were in tears,
saying how sorry and grateful you were.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:58.409
And now a divorce?

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:01.871
Do you think you can get away with that?

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:03.873
Divorce?

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.088
Divorce is out of the question.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.511
You're not even asking why.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.474
Shouldn't you ask
why I want to break up first?

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.144
All you're saying is you don't want to.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.229
You're not even asking why.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.149
As if you already know.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.570
This is why I want to break up.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.822
Are you okay?

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:21.659
Me?

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:25.496
Or Su-yeon?

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:30.418
I just think it might be too sudden.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:36.174
You have to untangle things slowly,
or they'll only get more knotted.

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:43.932
What if the special act
gets repealed again because you rush--

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.100
Then what I said
even before the inauguration

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.518
will turn out to be a lie.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.312
That's why I did it.

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:54.442
I had to show that

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:57.695
it wasn't to win more votes
or something I'd do once I'm elected

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.823
to convince Candidate Bae.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:04.035
I just wonder what it would've been like
if you had tried

00:04:04.118 --> 00:04:05.536
to convince your wife first.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:10.500
Only she can convince herself.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:14.796
But still…

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.298
You've been together for 20 years.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.092
I've been with her for 20 years.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.387
I have had enough.

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.014
It must be really hard

00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:28.685
to be you, and to be your wife too.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.318
I don't care.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:40.321
I don't care, but…

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:48.955
I've been drinking this
because she always prepared it for me,

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.499
but I've always wondered

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.919
for how long I will be drinking this,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.463
or if I can even drink it.

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.553
Schedule a meeting
with President Yu immediately.

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.513
Either convince or pressure,
I have to act.

00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:07.140
I'll contact him right away.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.183
And one more thing.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.854
EOM SUN-JEONG

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:14.689
There was a car accident on February 26.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.025
It was a hit-and-run.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.154
-What…
-See if there was a witness.

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:27.660
Did you hear me?

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.913
Yes, sir. I'll look into it.

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:50.308
She picked the white one as you said.

00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:52.101
I got goose bumps.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.312
How did you know?
Are you a fortune teller?

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:58.107
Well, nobody knows Cha Su-yeon
better than you do.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.984
Thanks to you, I got a jackpot!

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.110
Hurry over.

00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:05.865
I'm sorry.

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:08.201
You know the way out, right?

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:10.453
Yes.

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:12.955
I'll get going now.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.000
You're still awake.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:06:59.919
Aren't you hungry?

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.964
Do you want me to bring some snacks?

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.252
YEAR 1, CLASS 2 GROUP CHAT

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:46.067
You said you're an only child, right?

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.028
I'm an only child too.
I've always wanted an older sister.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.239
-Really?
-Yes.

00:08:52.114 --> 00:08:55.451
I'm an only child too,
but I don't want an older sister.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.745
I would rather have
a little sister like you.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:08:59.914
Really?

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:08.381
MESSAGE

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.978
THAT DAY,

00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:27.817
IN THE WALK-IN CLOSET…

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:42.999
No.

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.499
You scared me.

00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:28.210
It's just you.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.213
What are you doing here?

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.591
Did you like the gift for starting school?

00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:36.135
Those cookies were homemade with love.

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:37.928
I'm asking you.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.680
What brings you here at this hour?

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.767
Let me know if you liked them.
On the next special occasion--

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:43.893
Answer me first.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.902
What's wrong?

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:55.363
What are you doing here
with the lights off?

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:59.158
-You look--
-Answer me.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.080
Fine.

00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:08.417
Have you

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.170
seen my pendant?

00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:14.298
Why would you look for it here?

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.258
Because I lost it here.

00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:19.720
Exactly.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:22.973
Why did you lose it here?

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.191
It's you.

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:36.946
What?

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:46.080
You have it.

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:48.541
What are you talking about?

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.043
What's in there?

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:56.257
Give it to me.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.721
Hyun Ji-yu!

00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:41.886
Dad…

00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:44.180
is seeing a woman.

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:47.141
Let's get divorced.

00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:49.226
I want a divorce.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.687
You're not even asking why.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.023
Shouldn't you ask
why I want to break up first?

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:56.108
You're not even asking why.

00:12:56.692 --> 00:12:59.153
As if you already know.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:15.878
Ms. Cha!

00:13:19.715 --> 00:13:21.509
Ji-yu is…

00:14:16.146 --> 00:14:17.815
The stab wound has been stitched up.

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:19.817
You don't have to worry too much.

00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:21.861
The MRI results are clear,

00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:24.488
and there's no signs
of concussion or anything, but--

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:28.117
Isn't it a privilege to get an MRI scan
and even the results this late?

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:30.995
Hey--

00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:33.914
I wonder if other patients get
the same treatment.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.959
If we get special treatment,

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:38.836
it can cause a problem.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:44.341
She fell down the stairs, right?

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:45.759
That's what I heard.

00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:52.808
In cases of falls,
assessing the trauma is important,

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:55.519
but it's just as crucial to investigate
why the fall occurred.

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:58.564
It could be an underlying condition
like anemia or vertigo.

00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:00.441
So we ran a few tests on her.

00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:02.943
Let's talk again
once we get the blood test results.

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:05.696
So it's not special treatment.

00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:08.532
No, it's not.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.200
This is a standard medical procedure.

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.203
If she feels dizzy or sick
when she wakes up,

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:14.455
let us know right away.

00:15:14.538 --> 00:15:16.749
Will it leave a scar?

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:19.043
We did our best
to stitch it up nicely,

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:22.254
so let's see when it's completely healed.

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:23.964
Make sure she avoids any infection.

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.299
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.776
I thought I was having an arrhythmia.

00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:45.069
Are you okay?

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:48.322
I had no idea
she'd bring up "special treatment" there.

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:51.200
She's no ordinary woman indeed.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.910
Did you vote?

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:55.621
I did.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.083
I'm relieved.

00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:17.101
You're incredible.

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.939
How could you think
about things like special treatment,

00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:23.482
seeing your daughter lying here?

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.321
This is how I made you a president.

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:34.368
Because I've been taking
every step carefully,

00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:37.204
so you wouldn't be blamed
for special treatment and all.

00:16:37.287 --> 00:16:38.580
You're right.

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:41.375
You made me a president.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:46.547
And…

00:16:47.214 --> 00:16:49.383
the first thing you did as a president

00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:51.135
was the Do Tae-hoon Act.

00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:53.429
Was that the first thing you had to do?

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:56.098
That was the first bill I proposed
as a National Assembly member.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.435
When it was abolished,

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:01.228
you said I had to fight to change,

00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:03.355
because not everyone wants the change.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.734
You also said I had to win too.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.444
You said you don't fight to win

00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:11.530
but only the winners get to fight.

00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:14.742
So you want to fight now?

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:18.120
Now that you're president,
you want to change it?

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:21.081
For what? For whom?

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:23.125
You're always like this.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.462
You think
that special act will change the world?

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.090
What changes
if the truth about the fire comes out?

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.843
Why do you obsess
over what happened 15 years ago?

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.888
Politics are about tomorrow.

00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:37.431
They're about the future.

00:17:37.514 --> 00:17:40.225
If you're stuck
with a ghost from 15 years ago,

00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:43.145
you won't be able to change anything.

00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:46.940
-A person has died.
-Everyone dies.

00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:48.567
That's odd coming from you,

00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:52.362
someone who's so scared
her kid might get a scar on their face.

00:17:53.363 --> 00:17:54.531
Because I'm a mother.

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:57.993
I may have made you president,

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.829
but I am the mother of my only daughter!

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.916
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to do the both?

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.462
Lower your voice. You'll wake Ji-yu.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.219
Are you worried about Ji-yu now?

00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:20.849
Aren't you the one who made her anxious?

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:24.186
If you cared so much about her,

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:26.855
you shouldn't have gotten caught
in the first place.

00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:29.108
What do you mean?

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:30.192
I told you.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.445
I respect your personal life.

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:35.030
I'm not asking for perfection.

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:37.157
Whatever you do, don't get caught.

00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:38.909
What are you talking about?

00:18:38.992 --> 00:18:40.994
Are you going to keep playing innocent?

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:43.122
What did I do?

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:44.331
I saw it.

00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:54.633
Don't get up. Lie down.

00:18:54.716 --> 00:18:56.718
Are you dizzy or anything?

00:18:57.886 --> 00:18:59.012
Are you okay?

00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:00.722
Stay lying down.

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:03.684
And take it easy
until you get the results, just in case.

00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:05.602
I saw you and Lee Hwa-jin alone.

00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:11.316
Because of clothes, yes.

00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:15.362
Ji-yu, let's talk about this later.

00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:16.488
That day,

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:20.075
you were together. I saw it.

00:19:27.457 --> 00:19:28.625
Give me my pants.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:31.211
What?

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:33.338
Okay.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.666
I saw what you two did.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.461
It's not what you think.

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.297
What are you talking about?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.799
It's nothing like what you think.

00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:43.343
There was an accident like today,

00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:44.886
and I was worried about her--

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.264
I said I saw everything!

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.100
I saw it.

00:21:58.108 --> 00:21:59.526
It's not yours.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.363
Give it back to the owner.

00:22:07.534 --> 00:22:08.785
Get out.

00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:10.495
You don't deserve to be here.

00:22:11.204 --> 00:22:13.081
You're not my family.

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.833
You don't deserve it.

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:40.984
We're getting a divorce.

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:46.865
Ji-yu should know too.

00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:51.661
It hasn't been decided yet.

00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:53.830
It may make things
difficult for you for a while.

00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:56.833
But it's just between us.

00:22:57.292 --> 00:23:00.378
Just because we're splitting up
doesn't mean I don't love you.

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:01.755
Please keep that in mind.

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.674
Now you're all grown up--

00:23:04.758 --> 00:23:05.717
Enough.

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:08.929
Enough!

00:23:24.152 --> 00:23:24.986
Divorce?

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:28.782
President Yu started
investigating CEO Yang.

00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:30.117
Of course.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.953
You brought out
the special act like a bomb.

00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:35.872
Isn't it only natural to investigate
the illegal succession case

00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:37.415
that triggered the fire?

00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:38.792
The situation isn't that simple.

00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:44.047
Any indications that you're involved
in CEO Yang's illegal succession--

00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:45.340
Secretary Shin.

00:23:45.423 --> 00:23:47.759
We're having a discussion here.

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:57.269
Are you going to keep standing there?

00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:06.903
I apologize.

00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:17.914
Fine.

00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:20.625
Let's have some time apart.

00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:23.920
It'll be torture to see each other,
living in the same place.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.592
I'll send your clothes and belongings
through Secretary Shin.

00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:30.635
Let's take some time apart and--

00:24:31.178 --> 00:24:34.222
As long as we're married,
the investigation will continue.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.309
Throughout the entire campaign period…

00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:41.897
No, for the past 20 years,
this has been repeating over and over.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.984
That talk about Chairman Yang's
political funds reaching you through me.

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:47.819
There's no donor and no recipient.

00:24:47.903 --> 00:24:49.696
There's no proof and no witness.

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:51.740
It's nothing but a baseless accusation.

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:53.783
An investigation can make
anyone look guilty.

00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:56.828
What if they make up minor charges
and turn it into a witch hunt?

00:24:58.079 --> 00:25:00.207
President Yu wouldn't do that.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.249
How do you know?

00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:03.835
Trust me.

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:05.253
He would never do that.

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.672
He only has two months left,
but he's still the president.

00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:08.840
So what?

00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:12.135
As long as you get a divorce,
you'll be safe?

00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:15.055
I'm the one involved with CEO Yang,

00:25:15.138 --> 00:25:16.473
so without me,

00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:19.142
you'll be fine as president? Is that it?

00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:25.315
You can give up on the special act.

00:25:25.398 --> 00:25:27.150
As if it never happened.

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:29.110
Is that so important?

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:30.487
More important than me?

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:33.531
Is it more important than our marriage?

00:25:36.451 --> 00:25:38.078
There are a lot of things to do.

00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:40.121
There are a lot more important things.

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:43.083
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:47.128
I'm sorry.

00:25:54.594 --> 00:25:55.762
Is it…

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:57.889
It can't be.

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.813
Is it because of that kid?

00:26:27.335 --> 00:26:28.211
HWA-JIN

00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:47.689
Why are you sitting up?

00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:50.233
I'm okay. You can go.

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.153
It's okay.

00:26:53.236 --> 00:26:56.281
There's an empty bed here.
I can sleep there.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.952
You don't need to do this for me.

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:05.373
Look at what happened to you
after all you did for Dad.

00:27:10.003 --> 00:27:12.547
How can you be laughing now?

00:27:13.548 --> 00:27:16.092
I appreciate that you worry about me.

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:18.928
But for now, I want you to get some sleep.

00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:20.430
Then you'll feel better.

00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:22.640
I said, don't do this.

00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:25.143
You don't need to do this
for Dad or for me.

00:27:25.935 --> 00:27:27.812
Nobody forced you to.

00:27:29.272 --> 00:27:30.940
That's not it.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.569
Dad is just confused now.

00:27:34.652 --> 00:27:36.488
It happens sometimes.

00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:38.907
And this is an extra special occasion.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.617
He's extra confused now.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.535
-I will--
-Isn't it gross?

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:44.662
It's so gross it makes me want to puke.

00:27:46.373 --> 00:27:48.166
Remember what you said to me?

00:27:48.249 --> 00:27:51.169
You said it's his personal life,
so I should ignore it.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.838
And now you're getting a divorce!

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.980
I said I'd take care of it.

00:28:11.648 --> 00:28:12.941
No need to cry.

00:28:15.985 --> 00:28:17.445
I didn't want to cry.

00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:20.365
I really didn't want to. This is awful.

00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.661
I thought nothing could be worse

00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:28.790
than being your daughter.

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:31.626
But being your divorced daughter is worse.

00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:35.880
We're not getting divorced. Don't worry.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.050
This is the worst.

00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:45.890
Just divorce him, please!

00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:49.644
He's the one who did wrong,
yet he's the one asking for a divorce.

00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:51.104
Can you live with that?

00:28:51.187 --> 00:28:52.313
For whom?

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:53.648
For me?

00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:55.984
Do you think I would want that?

00:28:58.027 --> 00:28:59.154
I can't get a divorce.

00:29:04.784 --> 00:29:06.161
It's out of the question.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.419
BUTLER

00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:19.632
-Hello.
-The kid is gone.

00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:25.346
I was away for a bit,

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.724
and all her clothes
and belongings are gone.

00:29:28.475 --> 00:29:30.602
They say
her guardian signed her discharge.

00:29:40.528 --> 00:29:42.030
Excuse me.

00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:43.615
Where did the patient in Room 501 go?

00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:46.576
It's an emergency.

00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:48.995
I'm sorry. That's private--

00:29:49.078 --> 00:29:50.830
What's your relationship with the patient?

00:29:53.082 --> 00:29:55.168
She works for me.

00:29:55.251 --> 00:29:56.336
I'm sorry,

00:29:56.419 --> 00:29:59.589
but unless you're her family,
we can't give you her information.

00:29:59.672 --> 00:30:01.466
We checked her in.

00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:04.719
Then her guardian signed her discharge
without saying anything.

00:30:05.345 --> 00:30:09.057
Like I said, we can't share
the patient's personal information.

00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:21.694
She may be no ordinary woman,
but she can't do everything.

00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:23.780
Did we get the blood test results?

00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:25.406
Here.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.578
PATIENT: LEE HWA-JIN

00:30:33.122 --> 00:30:34.582
Is this accurate?

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.543
Why do you ask? Is something wrong?

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:37.710
Well…

00:30:39.087 --> 00:30:40.463
Nothing.

00:32:03.546 --> 00:32:05.089
I'll end it with her.

00:32:09.302 --> 00:32:10.887
I made the choice,

00:32:12.555 --> 00:32:14.098
so I should do it my way.

00:32:17.018 --> 00:32:18.770
There's no turning back.

00:32:22.398 --> 00:32:23.441
Here.

00:32:24.901 --> 00:32:26.653
I forgot to return it to you.

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:25.753
I'm Park Han-gyeol of Security.

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:27.714
I'll escort you home now.

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:30.258
Isn't it too soon?

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:33.928
The president himself gave a special order
when he heard what happened.

00:33:37.223 --> 00:33:39.267
Please thank him for looking after me.

00:33:40.727 --> 00:33:42.311
I will escort you home.

00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:43.396
No.

00:33:44.147 --> 00:33:45.356
To the transition team.

00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:49.110
Okay, I'll take you there right away.

00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:43.372
I want to stop by somewhere.

00:34:44.624 --> 00:34:45.792
As you wish.

00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:47.210
Where'd you like to go?

00:34:54.467 --> 00:34:55.426
Madam!

00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:02.308
Goodness, what are you doing?

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:04.602
Oh, dear.

00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:07.355
Wear this first.

00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:08.773
Here.

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:16.656
Ma'am.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.367
How do you find me so well?

00:35:20.201 --> 00:35:22.328
Gosh, let me see.

00:35:22.411 --> 00:35:23.496
My goodness.

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:25.748
You're hurt badly.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.838
I caused more trouble, didn't I?

00:35:31.921 --> 00:35:33.005
Hold on.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.348
He wants to divorce me.

00:35:42.431 --> 00:35:43.766
My goodness.

00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:53.192
You still bring this around?

00:35:53.276 --> 00:35:54.777
Ji-yu

00:35:54.861 --> 00:35:57.446
has a very weak skin,

00:35:58.281 --> 00:35:59.240
just like you.

00:36:00.616 --> 00:36:03.536
She gets papercuts so easily.

00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:06.581
I must have it with me all the time.

00:36:07.623 --> 00:36:08.666
There you go.

00:36:08.749 --> 00:36:11.043
Let's go up and get it properly treated.

00:36:14.046 --> 00:36:15.965
A wound will also grow, won't it?

00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:23.639
I'm a grownup, so it's fine.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.517
But my Ji-yu is still a baby.

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:32.356
You know, a wound you get
when you're young doesn't disappear.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.400
Instead, it grows with you.

00:36:34.483 --> 00:36:37.695
When it hurts and bleeds,
you can put ointment on it.

00:36:38.237 --> 00:36:42.909
It will take time,
but it will heal in the end.

00:36:48.581 --> 00:36:49.540
Here.

00:36:50.249 --> 00:36:51.834
Lean on me if it's hard.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.920
It's okay.

00:36:54.003 --> 00:36:57.089
If I keep saying it's hard,
it'll really become hard.

00:36:57.882 --> 00:37:02.470
Then should I say it's not hard at all?

00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:07.099
You can say it's not hard,
but it doesn't change that it's hard.

00:37:07.183 --> 00:37:10.561
Oh, dear. What should I do, then?

00:37:10.645 --> 00:37:13.272
Exactly. What should I do?

00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:16.484
Should I just accept it
saying that's how things are?

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:19.195
Should I tell myself,
"You should live regardless?"

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.406
I'm sorry.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.992
You're a lot older than me,

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:27.578
and here I am putting on airs.

00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:29.080
You can put on airs.

00:37:29.163 --> 00:37:30.706
You can whine, too.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:32.375
To me,

00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:34.543
you can do anything.

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.128
Okay?

00:37:42.218 --> 00:37:44.095
Get it treated, go home, and rest.

00:37:44.178 --> 00:37:45.429
I'll stay at the ward.

00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:47.932
No, I'll stay.

00:37:48.015 --> 00:37:52.061
Can you send over
some clothes he can wear tomorrow?

00:37:52.144 --> 00:37:54.939
Ask Secretary Shin for the address.

00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:57.817
Okay. I'll send it to the address.

00:38:04.573 --> 00:38:06.325
Why won't you ask anything?

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:11.789
I said he asked for a divorce
and that you should send him clothes,

00:38:12.498 --> 00:38:14.000
but you didn't ask me anything.

00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:16.669
Well,

00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:18.713
because I believe

00:38:19.922 --> 00:38:23.509
you can handle it fine by yourself.

00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:28.973
I'm glad to hear that.

00:38:29.056 --> 00:38:31.851
At least there's someone
who believes in me.

00:39:18.606 --> 00:39:19.940
Look here.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.320
One, two.

00:39:24.403 --> 00:39:26.489
-Hold on.
-What is it?

00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:28.824
Mother, join us.

00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:30.993
-I don't want to.
-Come on, join us.

00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:34.413
It will only look nice

00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:35.873
if you're in the picture.

00:39:35.956 --> 00:39:37.583
-I agree.
-Look at us.

00:39:37.666 --> 00:39:40.503
We look so dull
that the picture will smell like mold.

00:39:40.586 --> 00:39:42.755
You guys are helpless.

00:39:44.173 --> 00:39:46.592
Sun-jeong, take good pictures of us.

00:39:46.675 --> 00:39:48.928
I haven't taken pictures
with my mom for long.

00:39:49.011 --> 00:39:50.262
Why am I your mom?

00:39:50.346 --> 00:39:52.181
They're all my children.

00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:53.182
But not you.

00:39:53.265 --> 00:39:55.684
You call me mom
when you always cause trouble?

00:39:55.768 --> 00:39:57.728
You're not. You always cause trouble.

00:39:57.812 --> 00:40:00.523
-Good.
-Mom, you're making me upset.

00:40:00.606 --> 00:40:03.984
You should pay more attention to me
because I'm a troublemaker.

00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:06.654
Mother, Ki-ju did a great job
this time round.

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:09.281
I should've washed my face.

00:40:09.365 --> 00:40:11.826
Hey, nobody here has washed their face.

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:13.077
Who does?

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.829
We're protesting for two months.

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:16.914
Who would think of washing one's face?

00:40:16.997 --> 00:40:18.249
I agree.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.001
You look better

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:23.671
when you don't wash your face.

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:25.548
I washed my face!

00:40:26.298 --> 00:40:28.551
Hyun Min-cheol, don't laugh!

00:40:29.635 --> 00:40:30.511
Once it's over,

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.388
let's go to a bathhouse together.

00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:33.556
That sounds good.

00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:36.183
-Okay, the bathhouse is on me!
-What's gotten into you?

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:37.977
Yakult is on Tae-hoon.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.770
I hated going to a bathhouse,

00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:42.189
but he always lured me with Yakult.

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:45.651
Goodness, as if taking baths
was the only thing you hated.

00:40:45.734 --> 00:40:47.820
Back in the orphanage,

00:40:47.903 --> 00:40:49.905
it was such a hassle

00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:52.032
to get him to wash his face.

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:53.784
"Wash your face every day."

00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:55.453
I repeatedly taught him that.

00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:56.704
-That's not all.
-Stop.

00:40:56.787 --> 00:40:59.623
After that,
"Wash your hair every day too."

00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:01.375
-Teaching him that--
-Stop!

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:03.627
Yakult lady

00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:05.796
-Give me Yakult
-Give me Yakult

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.840
If there's no Yakult

00:41:07.923 --> 00:41:10.176
-Give me yogurt
-Give me yogurt

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:16.098
What?

00:41:16.182 --> 00:41:18.309
Why did you take it?
You should've warned us.

00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:20.519
It's best to look natural.

00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:23.397
-Sing it again!
-Again!

00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:25.524
-Yakult lady
-Yakult lady

00:41:25.608 --> 00:41:27.443
-Give me Yakult
-Give me Yakult

00:41:27.526 --> 00:41:29.361
If there's no Yakult

00:41:29.445 --> 00:41:32.031
-Give me yogurt
-Give me yogurt

00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:05.314
Go on, eat.

00:42:08.734 --> 00:42:10.903
We were so young back then.

00:42:10.986 --> 00:42:13.614
Not just young.
It was nice to see you guys

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:16.408
going against the world with that naivety.

00:42:16.492 --> 00:42:20.329
Just seeing that
made me feel proud and happy.

00:42:27.294 --> 00:42:30.172
I should act my age.

00:42:32.174 --> 00:42:33.217
Mother.

00:42:39.014 --> 00:42:40.307
Sun-jeong…

00:42:45.145 --> 00:42:46.605
What about Sun-jeong?

00:42:51.944 --> 00:42:54.029
She really liked your guksu.

00:42:55.155 --> 00:42:56.574
She did.

00:42:57.616 --> 00:42:58.909
"Mom."

00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:01.704
"How do you make it taste so good?"

00:43:01.787 --> 00:43:03.622
She'd ask again and again.

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:07.167
"I don't know why
mine won't taste like yours."

00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:10.879
And she'd get upset again and again.

00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:13.007
So I'd say,

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.676
"Making good guksu takes time."

00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:17.052
I'd comfort her.

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:19.555
Now,

00:43:20.389 --> 00:43:22.683
I'm sure she's making
good guksu somewhere.

00:43:23.726 --> 00:43:26.645
Long time has passed,
so she must've gotten good at it.

00:43:27.563 --> 00:43:28.981
What a cold girl.

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:33.444
How can she never call
after leaving so suddenly like that?

00:43:33.986 --> 00:43:35.070
Goodness.

00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:41.827
Start eating now before it gets soggy.

00:43:43.162 --> 00:43:44.413
Thank you for the food.

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:54.882
Don't worry, Grandma.
Uncle Ki-ju will recover soon.

00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:57.384
I'll do something…

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:00.888
What?

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:04.308
What…

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.896
My arm! My arm!

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.439
Let me go!

00:44:12.358 --> 00:44:13.233
My wallet!

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:15.444
There's my business card in my wallet.

00:44:15.527 --> 00:44:18.197
I'm Lawyer Kang Seon-ho.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.742
The lawyer of Yoon Ki-ju who is booked
for an assault.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.875
Just so you know, "Seon" in my name
doesn't mean "kind."

00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:31.585
It means "vicious."

00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:34.129
If you don't let me go now,
I can't promise

00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:37.591
what I'll do.

00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:40.302
You're holding down an innocent citizen.

00:44:40.386 --> 00:44:42.471
It's an attack!

00:44:42.554 --> 00:44:43.472
Let me go.

00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:57.403
My goodness.

00:44:57.486 --> 00:45:00.447
I'll need at least two weeks
to recover from this.

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.074
Let's call it even.

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:05.077
I'm talking about Ki-ju.

00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:07.579
Please show some leniency.

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:10.999
The media is exaggerating it,

00:45:11.083 --> 00:45:12.584
calling it a tomato attack.

00:45:12.668 --> 00:45:15.337
The case blew out of proportion.

00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:18.257
They'll decide not to refer if the victim

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.300
doesn't intend to punish him.

00:45:20.843 --> 00:45:22.302
So please.

00:45:23.137 --> 00:45:24.930
You guys aren't strangers either.

00:45:32.771 --> 00:45:33.939
The orphanage?

00:45:34.022 --> 00:45:35.399
Pardon?

00:45:37.025 --> 00:45:38.193
Yes.

00:45:38.277 --> 00:45:40.112
The orphanage, that's right.

00:45:40.195 --> 00:45:43.699
Just like someone,
I lived in an orphanage,

00:45:43.782 --> 00:45:46.160
and thanks to Grandma Geum-ok's support,

00:45:46.785 --> 00:45:48.370
I became a lawyer.

00:45:49.037 --> 00:45:50.622
From a nobody to somebody?

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:56.003
Give him a bowl of guksu, too.

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:59.423
Guksu isn't the problem now.

00:45:59.506 --> 00:46:00.632
Sit down.

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.886
-Grandma.
-Sit down.

00:46:07.097 --> 00:46:10.392
I'll make some for them while I'm at it.

00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:11.768
They must be hungry.

00:46:12.728 --> 00:46:14.605
It's okay, we're fine.

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.399
Let's sit down and eat.

00:46:18.984 --> 00:46:20.694
She makes delicious guksu.

00:47:06.782 --> 00:47:07.866
It was delicious.

00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:25.342
Here.

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:28.804
It's the same. Both you and guksu.

00:47:42.442 --> 00:47:43.944
Don't worry about Ki-ju.

00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:46.738
Don't do anything needless.

00:47:46.822 --> 00:47:48.198
Let the law decide.

00:47:49.866 --> 00:47:52.744
He may not look like it,
but he's pretty skilled.

00:47:52.828 --> 00:47:54.871
He won't be badly wronged.

00:47:58.292 --> 00:47:59.501
I'm sorry.

00:48:03.964 --> 00:48:05.257
Stay healthy.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.317
Come on, Grandma.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.195
One word from him,
and Ki-ju could've been let go.

00:48:27.279 --> 00:48:30.157
He's not someone you can meet as you wish.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.909
He should pay for his wrongdoings.

00:48:32.993 --> 00:48:35.871
I have so much work cut out for me
because of you.

00:48:35.954 --> 00:48:37.873
I can see the rough road ahead.

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:40.917
But…

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:46.465
it's taking so long.

00:48:47.174 --> 00:48:48.008
Sorry?

00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:50.719
Instead of paying for his sins,
he became the president.

00:48:52.304 --> 00:48:56.016
A guy like him calls me his mother,

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.602
and I can't even hit him on the head.

00:48:59.144 --> 00:49:02.856
Oh, dear.

00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:15.035
Go away.

00:49:15.744 --> 00:49:19.539
Go away.

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:28.734
The prosecutors investigating
the illegal management succession

00:50:28.817 --> 00:50:31.153
conducted a search and seizure
on H Group's

00:50:31.236 --> 00:50:33.405
core department, Future Strategy Office.

00:50:33.488 --> 00:50:36.199
Chairman Yang Hoon is denying all charges.

00:50:36.283 --> 00:50:38.118
People are paying attention to

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:40.829
how the Special Investigation Unit
of prosecution

00:50:40.912 --> 00:50:42.622
will prove the charges.

00:50:42.748 --> 00:50:44.291
THE 23RD PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION TEAM

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:46.168
Check this side now.

00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:48.754
-It's crooked!
-I'm reeling in now.

00:50:48.837 --> 00:50:51.214
-Pull.
-I'm reeling in.

00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:04.478
President-elect, smile.

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:06.313
Can you strike an encouraging pose?

00:51:07.022 --> 00:51:09.941
How is it going
with Chairman Yang's investigation?

00:51:11.276 --> 00:51:13.403
The prosecution will do the investigation.

00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:14.446
Come on.

00:51:14.946 --> 00:51:17.532
Chairman Yang and Cha Su-yeon are family.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.703
Everyone in politics and finance
is related by marriage.

00:51:21.787 --> 00:51:24.080
Chairman Yang and Cha Su-yeon are special.

00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:27.459
Chairman Yang's father
supported him in every way possible,

00:51:27.542 --> 00:51:29.294
and everyone knows that.

00:51:29.377 --> 00:51:33.465
But as soon as the president-elect
brought up the special bill,

00:51:33.548 --> 00:51:34.925
they started investigating

00:51:35.008 --> 00:51:38.053
Chairman Yang,
as if to respond to his action.

00:51:39.137 --> 00:51:40.597
What a coincidence.

00:51:41.389 --> 00:51:43.141
What do you want to say?

00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:45.769
President Yu might be holding Cha hostage

00:51:45.852 --> 00:51:49.231
and sending warning signs
to the president-elect.

00:51:49.314 --> 00:51:51.066
That he can't pass the special bill.

00:51:56.363 --> 00:51:58.240
Why won't you say anything?

00:51:59.825 --> 00:52:01.451
If I say anything, you'll put it

00:52:01.535 --> 00:52:05.038
in your article saying it was
the president-elect's attendant's words.

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:07.415
You won't fall for it.

00:52:07.499 --> 00:52:10.502
-Please look here.
-Please move forward to take photos.

00:52:12.379 --> 00:52:16.007
By the way,
when will he come to my news magazine?

00:52:16.675 --> 00:52:18.718
As soon as I sort out the schedule.

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:21.221
If you come to mine last
after going to others

00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:24.099
like you did during the election,
I'll get really upset.

00:52:24.933 --> 00:52:26.476
You sure hold a grudge.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.687
The schedule got messed up then.

00:52:37.654 --> 00:52:39.114
Let's take pictures.

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:42.158
One, two, three.

00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:43.994
Did you see our election broadcast?

00:52:44.077 --> 00:52:47.372
I practically wrote a whole epic for him.

00:52:47.455 --> 00:52:49.749
I helped out
with the start of the new regime,

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:51.126
so come to my show first.

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.255
I got it. Don't worry.

00:52:56.756 --> 00:53:00.594
I'll need to ask you a favor after favor
for the upcoming five years.

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:02.053
Right.

00:53:02.762 --> 00:53:04.848
What happened yesterday?

00:53:04.931 --> 00:53:06.433
Yesterday?

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:08.810
When we called the president-elect
from the studio.

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:14.107
What is it?

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.902
I freaked out thinking
it would be messed up.

00:53:16.985 --> 00:53:20.572
If it weren't for me cleaning up the mess,
things would've been really bad.

00:53:21.781 --> 00:53:24.326
Where on earth was he?

00:53:25.452 --> 00:53:27.829
Let's do a cheer.

00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:29.873
One, two, three.

00:53:29.956 --> 00:53:31.333
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:53:33.084 --> 00:53:34.419
Don't tell me

00:53:35.754 --> 00:53:37.339
he disappeared without telling you.

00:53:38.548 --> 00:53:39.758
At that hour?

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:55.315
Exactly on time.

00:54:04.824 --> 00:54:06.785
Excuse me, what is this?

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:10.497
What's happening?

00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:13.792
I don't know, it's too sudden.

00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:15.043
Let's check and talk later.

00:54:15.126 --> 00:54:18.213
Who sent these? Tell us.

00:54:18.964 --> 00:54:21.091
Where did these come from?
Haseong-dong, right?

00:54:21.174 --> 00:54:23.426
-Who sent these?
-What's inside?

00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:24.844
-What is it?
-Tell us.

00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:27.639
You can say where it came from.

00:54:27.722 --> 00:54:29.516
-What's inside?
-Sorry.

00:54:30.183 --> 00:54:31.309
Tell us.

00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:33.103
Who sent these, then?

00:54:33.186 --> 00:54:35.021
-Tell us.
-What?

00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:51.913
Cha Su-yeon sent them indeed.

00:54:56.751 --> 00:54:57.836
We'll head to the hospital.

00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.838
Did you see the photo I sent?

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.216
His stuff was delivered to the office.

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:05.927
I checked, and it was sent by Cha Su-yeon.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:10.015
It's divorce. Use that exact word.

00:55:10.098 --> 00:55:13.101
Dig up evidence that Cha is involved
in Yang's succession

00:55:13.184 --> 00:55:15.103
and fallouts between her and her husband--

00:55:16.104 --> 00:55:17.313
Checking the facts?

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:20.150
What I'm seeing at the scene is the fact.

00:55:20.233 --> 00:55:22.736
His wife kicked him out
on the very first day,

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.612
and you want to check the facts?

00:55:24.696 --> 00:55:26.031
Say something.

00:55:30.535 --> 00:55:32.412
It's not just divorce.

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:34.205
It's a divorce war.

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:38.001
Nothing has been confirmed yet.

00:55:38.084 --> 00:55:39.836
We'll end it here. Thank you.

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:42.005
Watch out!

00:55:56.853 --> 00:56:00.315
The president-elect and his wife's
divorce rumor caused a huge stir.

00:56:02.734 --> 00:56:04.486
Some are speculating that

00:56:04.569 --> 00:56:08.531
the divorce is caused by Chairman Yang's
illegal succession investigation.

00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:13.203
The accusations made by the politicians
about Cha being the mastermind

00:56:13.286 --> 00:56:15.413
behind the scenes has surfaced again.

00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:17.749
With the claim that
the reason behind the divorce

00:56:17.832 --> 00:56:20.543
is that the prosecution
discovered the evidence of

00:56:20.627 --> 00:56:23.546
Cha being involved
in Chairman Yang's succession…

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:29.385
What is it?

00:56:29.928 --> 00:56:31.387
What happened?

00:56:31.471 --> 00:56:32.430
I don't know.

00:56:33.306 --> 00:56:35.391
I said I'd go back as soon as I ate.

00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:36.643
Go back to the wake.

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:38.436
There's no need to.

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.271
Nobody stops by anyway.

00:56:40.355 --> 00:56:43.566
That's why someone should be there.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.318
We can't make him feel lonely.

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:47.195
It was the president's special order.

00:56:47.278 --> 00:56:49.614
Why are you so rude to your older brother?

00:56:49.697 --> 00:56:51.324
Seriously.

00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:54.285
Don't call yourself older anything.
You were born five minutes early.

00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:56.037
Let's go.

00:56:56.121 --> 00:56:56.955
Wait.

00:56:57.038 --> 00:56:59.874
Can I eat one cup noodles
at a convenience store?

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:03.920
I've been having yukgaejang all day long,
and I'm sick of it.

00:57:04.003 --> 00:57:06.047
You gobbled up
all the boiled pork yourself.

00:57:06.131 --> 00:57:07.924
I'm glad you got sick of it.

00:57:08.007 --> 00:57:11.553
You had a grand feast
as if you were filming an eating show.

00:57:11.636 --> 00:57:14.264
A mourner needs to be on a full stomach.

00:57:16.307 --> 00:57:18.351
You should stop running the channel

00:57:18.435 --> 00:57:20.937
about Cha Su-yeon
and start an eating show.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.314
You're a big eater.

00:57:23.398 --> 00:57:24.899
You were born to be.

00:57:24.983 --> 00:57:27.819
-Eating suits you, not fashion.
-Be quiet!

00:57:31.197 --> 00:57:32.615
Here.

00:57:32.699 --> 00:57:35.034
Come back a few more times
to get it redressed.

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:36.744
Make sure it's not infected.

00:57:39.247 --> 00:57:40.457
Nurse?

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.333
I think you should come out.

00:57:42.417 --> 00:57:45.336
The reporters are forcing their way in.

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:46.504
What?

00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:49.507
-Hello?
-Madam!

00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:00.435
It's Cha Su-yeon.

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:04.230
Why run away? We did nothing wrong.

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:06.441
-There she is!
-Miss Cha Su-yeon!

00:58:07.734 --> 00:58:09.235
Divorce is a private matter.

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:11.112
I can't let them take your photo.

00:58:11.196 --> 00:58:12.780
Why? Everyone already knows my face.

00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:15.325
It's different.

00:58:15.408 --> 00:58:16.701
What's different?

00:58:17.911 --> 00:58:19.162
The elevator.

00:58:19.913 --> 00:58:20.955
Don't think so.

00:58:21.039 --> 00:58:22.999
Mom!

00:58:23.082 --> 00:58:24.501
The photos they take now

00:58:24.584 --> 00:58:26.794
will mark you and haunt you forever.

00:58:26.878 --> 00:58:28.671
Please just listen to me.

00:58:30.215 --> 00:58:32.050
Where is she? Miss Cha Su-yeon!

00:58:32.133 --> 00:58:33.593
The stairs!

00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:36.804
-Miss Cha!
-Miss Cha, tell us your thoughts.

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:42.352
Madam, where are you now?

00:58:42.936 --> 00:58:43.811
Meet me in front.

00:58:43.895 --> 00:58:45.772
Not the front, come to the back door.

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:47.607
I parked my car there.

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:51.319
-Miss Cha, say something!
-Stop there, Miss Cha!

00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:53.112
You can refute the rumors now,

00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:54.447
or we'll upload the news as is!

00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:56.824
-Miss Cha, say something!
-Miss Cha!

00:59:02.956 --> 00:59:05.124
Oh? Cha Su-yeon…

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:06.251
Madam, this way!

00:59:06.334 --> 00:59:08.211
Miss Cha, let's have an interview!

00:59:08.294 --> 00:59:11.506
-Excuse me.
-Is it true that you're getting divorced?

00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:12.840
Hold on, Miss Cha.

00:59:12.924 --> 00:59:14.259
-Miss Cha!
-Miss Cha!

00:59:18.304 --> 00:59:20.390
Let's go to the back door!

00:59:24.352 --> 00:59:25.436
Wear your seat belt.

00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:31.192
Miss Cha Su-yeon! Miss Cha Su-yeon!

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:34.404
Miss Cha Su-yeon!

00:59:44.038 --> 00:59:44.914
Hurry up!

01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:13.359
-Did you put on your seat belt?
-Yes.

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:37.175
Mom.

01:00:37.258 --> 01:00:38.509
Hold tight.

01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:50.188
Mom.

01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:51.522
It's okay.

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:55.943
Did you see that? Poor Ji-yu.

01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:57.737
Were they faking it until now?

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.863
All of that was for show?

01:00:58.946 --> 01:01:01.032
Serves her right.

01:01:01.115 --> 01:01:02.241
Hit rock bottom at once.

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.999
Don't look, Ji-yu. Don't look.

01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:11.751
Mom!

01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:10.810
Let's not result to a lawsuit.

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:13.187
Let's divorce by consent.

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:15.398
If you did bug him
as the president-elect claimed,

01:02:15.481 --> 01:02:18.192
isn't it you who broke apart the family?

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:20.778
I'm divorcing for Su-yeon's sake.

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.196
Don't hurt her anymore.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.991
You can't get a divorce.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:27.660
If you do, you lose your rights
as the first lady.

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:31.080
I'm the one who made him a president.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:35.042
Then I should take half of
what the president owns.

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:36.210
Isn't that right?

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:39.130
