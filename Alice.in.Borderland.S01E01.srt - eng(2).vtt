MAX VOLCANO

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.461
FRACTAL GEOMETRY

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.713
EVERYTHING ABOUT SACRED GEOMETRY

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.715
AUDI AND BMW
3D GEOMETRY

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.682
You're a shitty brother.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:00:59.601
Crap!

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.524
You didn't go to the interview
I set up again?

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:14.032
I begged the company for it.
You should really show up, for my sake.

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:18.286
Did I ask you to go and set it up?

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.664
Dad said this is the last time
he's helping.

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.460
He told me not to help you
look for a job anymore, either.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.505
I never asked for your help.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:29.964
But you need it.

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:32.717
You're a parasite in this house.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.055
Fine, okay.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:38.515
I'll leave then.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.893
If only we could reboot reality.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:47.065
You were better when Mom was alive.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:05.291
Ryohei.

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:08.920
I don't need you
causing trouble for your brother.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.346
RESIDENCE

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:37.365
CHOTA SEGAWA, DAIKICHI KARUBE

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.368
ARISU: CAN I GO TO THE BAR?

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.374
ARISU: I'M OFFICIALLY HOMELESS.

00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:12.609
Oh, Mr. Boss, sir.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.319
- How are ya?
- Oh, it's Karube. You're in early today.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:15.987
Uh…

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.031
I just decided to come in a bit earlier.

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.741
Why are you here at this hour, Kazu?

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.576
I have something to take care of.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.077
Whoa!

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:30.043
ARISU: KARUBE, YOU THERE?

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.378
KARUBE

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.716
How dare you put your hands
on someone else's woman!

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.468
Stop it!

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.136
Shut up, bitch!

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.184
I feel better now.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:05.203
{\an8}ARISU: CHOTA, YOU WORKING?
LET ME STAY OVER.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:11.376
CHOTA

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.178
Here you go.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.137
Ah!

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.641
I'm sorry that you have to do this
when you're so busy, Chota.

00:04:26.724 --> 00:04:29.602
This money will really help us out.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.604
Let's make this the last time, okay?

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.400
What do you mean, the last time?

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:40.780
ARISU: HEY, ARE YOU GUYS IGNORING ME?

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.324
Don't you understand,
the air here in Tokyo

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:46.035
is being polluted every day
by the powers of industry?

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.663
We need to make it clean again!

00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:52.041
Here, here, there.
Everything has to be reclaimed!

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.960
Yeah, I get it already!

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.629
I'm late.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:57.755
Thank you!

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:04.929
ARISU: FINE.

00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:23.781
KARUBE: I WAS FIRED FROM MY JOB.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.621
Karube's timing really sucks.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.499
ARISU: SERIOUSLY? WHEN?

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:37.754
KARUBE: RIGHT NOW. I'M JOBLESS NOW!

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.465
{\an8}ARISU: SERIOUSLY? WHEN?
KARUBE: RIGHT NOW. I'M JOBLESS NOW!

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:46.804
{\an8}CHOTA: GOOD JOB GETTING FIRED.
I'M SKIPPING WORK RIGHT NOW.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.060
{\an8}KARUBE: YOU SHOULD WORK, CHOTA.
YOU'RE POOR.

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:56.522
{\an8}ARISU: I LEFT HOME.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.400
CHOTA: GOOD WORK.

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.402
ARISU: I NEED A DRINK.

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:03.029
CHOTA: ME TOO!

00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:04.989
KARUBE: LET'S GO, THEN!

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.992
ARISU: GO FIND A JOB, KARUBE.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.660
CHOTA: YOU TOO, ARISU.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:14.749
KARUBE: OKAY,
LET'S MEET IN FRONT OF SHIBUYA STATION.

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:16.667
ARISU: OKAY!

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:17.585
CHOTA: OKAY!

00:06:17.668 --> 00:06:18.586
Whoa!

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.591
ARISU: I STEPPED ON SOMEONE'S VOMIT.

00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:26.135
CHOTA: GOOD JOB STEPPING ON VOMIT.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:44.654
ARISU: I'M HAVING THE WORST DAY.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:46.906
CHOTA: ME TOO.

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:48.616
KARUBE: SAME.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:54.705
{\an8}ARISU: I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
DOING MY BEST SINCE THIS MORNING.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:59.585
{\an8}KARUBE:
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOUR GAME?

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:06.259
ARISU: FOUND YOU, KARUBE!

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:08.010
FIND YOUR NEW SELF

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.388
KARUBE: HEY!

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:12.181
CHOTA: HEY!

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.767
ARISU: HEY.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.520
Hey, we're right here.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.398
You wanna go get a drink?

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.151
It's early. Not many bars open.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.402
Man.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.197
That settles that,
guess we're going to a mall again.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.581
I'd be down with going to
a deserted island.

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:43.588
I'd be down with zombies
showing up in Shibuya.

00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.382
Everyone here gets bitten,
and they all turn into zombies.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.926
Stop it with the zombie talk, will ya?

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.054
If zombies did show up here,
only Karube would survive.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.557
You'd knock 'em out with one punch.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.100
I doubt that.

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.894
You'd be the one to survive, Arisu.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.479
Me? Why's that?

00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:03.107
Because I know you'd outsmart 'em.

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:09.697
Arisu, free advice…

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.619
You should stop hanging out with us
and go live your life.

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:17.663
You should do it.

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:20.416
Huh?

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:22.376
What's with him?

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.723
Shit, let's do this.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:18.808
{\an8}- Come on!
- Whoa…

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:20.935
- What are you doing?
- Whoa…

00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:22.770
This is the first day
of your independence!

00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:24.105
Shut up, take a picture!

00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:26.023
- Okay!
- Oh…

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.650
- Comin' through!
- Whoa!

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:28.985
Step aside!

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:31.529
- Hey, this is dangerous!
- Give way!

00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:32.697
Hey, hey!

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.199
Hey, wait! Let me take a picture!

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.200
Whoa!

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.743
Wait, what are you doing?

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:38.869
Turn towards me!

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.830
Hey! Stop, no pictures!

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:43.207
- Big smile, big smile!
- Look here, look here!

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.084
Come on, Arisu!

00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:46.836
- Here, look at the camera!
- I'm sorry, everyone!…

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:49.213
Stop, dammit! Fuck!

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:51.882
Now that's a good face!

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.896
Oh…

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.734
That is perfect!

00:10:09.817 --> 00:10:11.611
Whoo!

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:12.903
Great!

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.245
Shibuya!

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.789
You rock!

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.710
Oh, get off! Get off!

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.211
Put me down. Whoa…

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.838
Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:33.507
You guys are crazy!

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:37.345
Watch out! Look out!

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:38.888
Hurry up!

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.139
Look, fireworks!

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:41.682
Run for your lives!

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.061
Moron!

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:49.148
Guys, wa-- wait.

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:50.316
It's the cops!

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.234
- Whoa! Go, go, go…
- We'll be in trouble!

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.361
Let's get out of here!

00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:55.905
Run! Run!

00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:05.998
- The stairs!
- Yeah!

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:08.793
- Whoa!
- Oh, watch out!

00:11:08.876 --> 00:11:10.961
- Head for the john!
- Turn around! Turn around!

00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:12.755
Sorry!

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:17.259
Go, go, go!

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.471
- Let me lock it. Gimme a second.
- Come on.

00:11:20.554 --> 00:11:23.057
- Just hurry it up, for fuck's sake!
- Damn!

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:40.783
CHOTA: WHO FARTED?

00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:49.500
{\an8}CHOTA: WHO WAS IT?
OWN UP AND SNIFF UP YOUR OWN FART!

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.170
It was you, right?

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:15.901
I don't hear anything.

00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:33.669
I'll go check it out.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:34.670
All right.

00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:37.256
- Be careful.
- Yeah, okay.

00:15:29.553 --> 00:15:31.096
Jesus.

00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:18.704
Baby?

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.794
Baby?

00:17:39.808 --> 00:17:43.729
WHERE'S THE FILE?!
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!! - TAKAGI

00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:16.655
What the fuck?

00:19:45.809 --> 00:19:47.186
Hey!

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:51.732
Hello?

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.655
Anyone there?

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:07.581
Hello?

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:33.440
Seen anyone?

00:20:33.523 --> 00:20:34.524
No!

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.152
See anybody?

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.404
There's no one anywhere!

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.788
Even my phone isn't working.

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:03.637
Was there some kind of
evacuation drill today?

00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:07.307
Not that I know about.

00:21:09.142 --> 00:21:12.396
Some sort of event?
A flash mob, maybe?

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:15.399
The scale of this
is way too big for that.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:21.780
What if it's only
the three of us left alive?

00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:40.632
This doesn't seem all that bad to me.

00:21:42.175 --> 00:21:43.135
What?

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:46.221
Don't you find this exciting?

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:49.850
You out of your mind?

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:54.354
You're right. I think it's kinda cool.

00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:55.314
Why?

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:58.275
'Cause I don't have to go to work.
That's good.

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:01.111
Are you guys crazy?

00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:03.113
No one to be angry with us.

00:22:03.196 --> 00:22:05.449
And we can eat and drink
all we want, right?

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.744
You'll be a virgin your whole life.

00:22:09.703 --> 00:22:12.456
Huh? Don't think I'd like that.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.806
Any virgins out there?

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.141
You tryin' to scare 'em?

00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:32.976
I'd do it!

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:39.149
- Isn't this great?
- Awesome! Whoo!

00:22:39.232 --> 00:22:40.942
- Guys.
- Arisu!

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.903
Stop joking around, you guys!

00:22:42.986 --> 00:22:44.196
- Karube!
- Karube!

00:22:45.655 --> 00:22:47.074
- That hurts!
- Huh?

00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:49.159
Huh?

00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:53.497
Fuck.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.841
WELCOME, PLAYERS
THE GAME WILL COMMENCE IN A MOMENT

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:10.597
WELCOME, PLAYERS.
THE GAME WILL COMMENCE IN A MOMENT

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.640
Game?

00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:21.400
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:26.154
- Over there.
- Hm?

00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:29.366
Lights?

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.201
Somebody must be there.

00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:34.871
Let's go.

00:23:34.955 --> 00:23:35.831
Okay.

00:24:11.908 --> 00:24:18.915
GM BUILDING

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:37.392
THE GAME ARENA IS UP AHEAD

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.746
1 PER PERSON

00:25:59.015 --> 00:26:02.060
1 PER PERSON

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:21.079
FACE RECOGNITION IN PROGRESS
PLEASE WAIT FOR A MOMENT

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:23.206
It's got face recognition.

00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:25.166
Do we use these phones?

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:28.920
There's no signal.

00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:31.631
{\an8}The outgoing call function
is disabled.

00:26:32.132 --> 00:26:33.091
GAME
PLEASE WAIT

00:26:33.174 --> 00:26:35.218
Please wait
for the game to commence.

00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:38.680
Currently, there are three participants.

00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:43.018
One minute remaining
until registration closes.

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.603
What the hell is this?

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:47.147
A game.

00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:51.067
Huh… Finally, a person.

00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:54.154
Hey. Uh, do you know where everyone went?

00:27:11.421 --> 00:27:12.922
What the hell was that?

00:27:13.548 --> 00:27:14.758
A laser?

00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:15.675
CHOTA SEGAWA

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:18.511
Cross the borderline,
and you'll never return.

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:21.848
You have no choice but to play the game.

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:34.361
- Whoa!
- Hey!

00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:41.409
You heard what she said.
Don't do it.

00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:48.041
Oh!

00:27:48.124 --> 00:27:50.001
I'm so relieved!

00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:53.046
Jeez, I thought there was no one else…

00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:58.635
My condolences.

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:08.978
Registration is now closed.

00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:11.731
{\an8}The game will now commence.

00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:13.316
Game?

00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:16.653
Game, "Dead or Alive".

00:28:16.736 --> 00:28:17.821
DEAD OR ALIVE

00:28:17.904 --> 00:28:20.407
Difficulty, Three of Clubs.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.242
Three of Clubs?

00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:23.910
What does that mean?

00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:26.246
Rule.

00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:30.166
Select the correct door
within the stipulated time frame.

00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:31.668
What?

00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:33.294
Clear condition.

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:36.339
Leave the building within the time limit.

00:28:36.423 --> 00:28:37.966
LEAVE THE BUILDING
WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT.

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:41.469
START

00:28:47.142 --> 00:28:48.852
You'll die if you just stand there.

00:28:58.153 --> 00:28:59.362
We have no choice.

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.135
The time limit for this room…

00:29:22.218 --> 00:29:23.052
TIME LIMIT

00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:24.721
…is two minutes.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:43.698
What is this?

00:29:50.497 --> 00:29:51.331
LIVE

00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:52.665
Alive…

00:29:52.749 --> 00:29:53.583
DIE

00:29:53.666 --> 00:29:54.667
…or Dead.

00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:59.088
Is this really a game?

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.177
I think… this is really getting exciting.

00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:11.184
I'm sure this must be
doors to an art gallery.

00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:15.980
I want to go… home.

00:30:16.689 --> 00:30:19.359
It'll be fine. You're with us.

00:30:19.442 --> 00:30:22.278
We'll play the game,
get our prize, and go home. Okay?

00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:24.030
Our prize?

00:30:24.113 --> 00:30:26.115
Yeah, I'm sure we're gonna get one.

00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:27.659
One minute remaining.

00:30:27.742 --> 00:30:28.827
Arisu.

00:30:29.452 --> 00:30:30.954
Which door do you think it is?

00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:35.917
Dead or Alive.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.086
Well, it can't be the skeleton, right?

00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:41.631
And if we choose the wrong door?

00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:43.967
The answer is "Alive".

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:46.219
Open the door that says "Alive".

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.263
How do you know?

00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:51.307
Because… obviously, it's the "Alive" door.

00:30:54.602 --> 00:30:55.812
Do you guys smell something?

00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:57.981
Oh, fuck!

00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:01.568
Is it a fire?

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:05.446
- Thirty seconds remaining.
- The answer is "Alive"!

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.574
- Hurry and open the door!
- Open it yourself!

00:31:07.657 --> 00:31:09.325
What'll happen if our time's up?

00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:11.035
We won't get more time. Hurry!

00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:12.453
Why do you think
it's the right one?

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.831
'Cause we shouldn't
choose the "Dead" door, right?

00:31:14.914 --> 00:31:16.207
Twenty seconds remaining.

00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:18.293
I can't take it, I can't breathe!

00:31:28.761 --> 00:31:31.514
Is… she dead?

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:35.435
Ten seconds remaining.

00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:39.230
DIE

00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:40.481
Five,

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:42.734
four, three, two…

00:31:42.817 --> 00:31:44.319
- Chota!
- …one.

00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:46.738
Move!

00:31:48.114 --> 00:31:49.699
The time limit for this room

00:31:49.782 --> 00:31:52.035
is one minute and fifty seconds.

00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:59.000
She really is dead.

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:00.376
What the hell is this?

00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:04.088
You were the one who killed that girl.

00:32:04.172 --> 00:32:06.591
But you guys survived
because of me, didn't you?

00:32:06.674 --> 00:32:07.508
What?

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:08.885
Blame me all you want.

00:32:08.968 --> 00:32:11.137
If you guys don't think fast,
you're gonna die too.

00:32:13.222 --> 00:32:14.390
Damn it!

00:32:15.391 --> 00:32:17.685
Do we choose
the "Die" door now, huh?

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:21.022
Since the last one was "Die"
the next one should be "Live".

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:23.399
Yeah, but maybe
that's what they want us to think.

00:32:23.483 --> 00:32:26.194
- But it's hard to choose "Die".
- Wait a second.

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:29.656
I think that this is a game
where we choose a sacrifice.

00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:30.615
A sacrifice?

00:32:30.698 --> 00:32:32.784
There's probably no difference
in the doors.

00:32:32.867 --> 00:32:34.535
What's important is who opens them.

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:37.455
They want us to choose a person
within the time limit.

00:32:37.538 --> 00:32:39.123
You sacrificed that girl.

00:32:39.874 --> 00:32:41.376
Why don't you open the next door?

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:44.504
Because I believe if I survive,
it'll be for the good of all mankind.

00:32:44.587 --> 00:32:47.006
Well, don't we feel good about ourselves?

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.218
One minute has passed.

00:32:53.262 --> 00:32:55.390
No one will open a door at this rate.

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.392
We're all gonna die in the fire
if time runs out!

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:58.935
Then why don't you open it?

00:32:59.936 --> 00:33:01.854
You want me to open it,
why don't you do it yourself?

00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:03.481
You want someone else to open it!

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.448
All right, I'll open it.

00:33:16.285 --> 00:33:17.120
Arisu!

00:33:17.203 --> 00:33:18.871
LIVE

00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:21.290
DIE

00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:25.545
Stop, Arisu. Don't listen to her!

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.090
I'll open the door, fuck!

00:33:39.392 --> 00:33:41.144
Thirty seconds remaining.

00:33:48.609 --> 00:33:49.527
Arisu!

00:34:01.247 --> 00:34:04.167
See? Not so easy, is it?

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.335
Even you would have sacrificed that girl!

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:08.087
Shut the fuck up!

00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:09.922
Twenty seconds remaining.

00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:12.341
I'll do it.

00:34:12.425 --> 00:34:13.926
He's not very lucky, anyway.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.095
- Karube!
- We'll take turns.

00:34:19.265 --> 00:34:20.475
You'll go after me.

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.852
Ten seconds remaining.

00:34:23.352 --> 00:34:24.187
Karube.

00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:29.650
Karube!

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:32.987
Five,

00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:34.989
- four, three…
- Karube!

00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:36.699
- …two, one.
- Hurry!

00:34:40.703 --> 00:34:42.705
The time limit for this room

00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:44.874
is one minute and forty seconds.

00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:47.877
The time limit is shortening.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.587
I can't do this anymore.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.631
We're taking turns.

00:34:51.714 --> 00:34:53.007
You open the door next.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.929
- I'll choose the door.
- Wait.

00:34:58.012 --> 00:35:00.014
Go ahead and open.

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:01.224
Open it!

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:03.518
I can't.

00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:11.317
Arisu, what do you think?

00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:12.944
Think?

00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:16.280
You always say there are solutions
built into every game, right?

00:35:16.364 --> 00:35:18.616
- But this isn't a game.
- You can figure it out.

00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:21.702
You've always solved the puzzle games
that I could never figure out.

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:24.622
- So do it!
- Karube, this is not a game.

00:35:25.164 --> 00:35:26.374
It's all about luck.

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:28.709
- Arisu, just think!
- One minute has passed.

00:35:29.585 --> 00:35:31.045
Was there a clue somewhere?

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:34.924
Think back.
Together, we came into this building…

00:35:35.007 --> 00:35:36.217
Remember the time limit!

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.469
- And then, we went into the elevator--
- I won't do this!

00:35:38.553 --> 00:35:40.805
Don't give up, Arisu!
You can reboot this game!

00:35:40.888 --> 00:35:42.390
It's impossible, I'm telling you!

00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:44.559
- We're going to die.
- You're the gamer!

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:47.687
While I was working my ass off,
you were sitting on a couch playing! Huh?

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.105
You think that makes you better?

00:35:49.188 --> 00:35:50.982
The only thing you really know
is how to fight.

00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:53.109
- How is that better?
- Yeah? Well, I'll show you how.

00:35:53.192 --> 00:35:54.986
Stop it, Karube!

00:35:57.196 --> 00:35:58.698
GM BUILDING

00:35:58.781 --> 00:36:00.074
Wait.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.828
Wait a minute.

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:06.747
Are you okay, Arisu?

00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:13.171
Thirty seconds remaining.

00:36:18.885 --> 00:36:20.303
BMW 523.

00:36:20.386 --> 00:36:21.262
Huh?

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.306
It was a BMW 523.

00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:25.099
Yeah?

00:36:28.978 --> 00:36:30.062
The answer is "Die".

00:36:30.646 --> 00:36:32.773
- How do you know?
- Ten seconds remaining.

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:34.192
We gotta hurry!

00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:35.651
I'll open it up.

00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:38.529
Arisu! Are you sure the answer is "Die"?

00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:39.488
Please…

00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:40.448
Five,

00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:41.782
four…

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:42.867
…three…

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.202
- This means I'm right!
- …two…

00:36:44.285 --> 00:36:45.578
…one.

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:49.957
The time limit for this room

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.460
- is one minute and thirty seconds.
- Where to next?

00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:53.961
Do you know which one this time?

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:58.341
My father has a BMW 523.
It's 4 meters, 94 centimeters.

00:36:58.424 --> 00:37:00.426
One of 'em
was parked beside the building.

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.765
The length of the building
is equivalent to four of those cars.

00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:09.393
This means that the building
is approximately 24 meters in length.

00:37:09.477 --> 00:37:12.897
And this room… If I measure with my feet,

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.399
One, two, three…

00:37:17.443 --> 00:37:19.195
It should be around six meters.

00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:21.864
According to the evacuation map,

00:37:21.948 --> 00:37:23.950
the elevator
is at the corner of the building.

00:37:24.784 --> 00:37:26.035
1F EVACUATION ROUTE MAP

00:37:27.536 --> 00:37:29.455
The shape of the building
is square.

00:37:30.289 --> 00:37:31.916
This room is also square-shaped.

00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:35.378
Assuming that one side
of the building is 20 meters

00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:38.172
and the length of a single room
is 6 meters, that's three rooms a side.

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.590
One minute has passed.

00:37:39.674 --> 00:37:41.175
- I need something to write on!
- Uh…

00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:43.094
- Here.
- Here, here, here, here, here.

00:37:45.471 --> 00:37:47.014
We're in a square building.

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:49.350
Assuming that each room is square,

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:51.686
this means that this floor has nine rooms.

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:54.105
- It's just like a puzzle.
- Arisu's a genius at them.

00:37:54.188 --> 00:37:55.648
We started from this room.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.900
The high-school girl died…

00:37:57.984 --> 00:37:59.944
…in this room.

00:38:00.027 --> 00:38:02.571
Thanks to Karube, we moved forward.

00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:05.283
This means that the door to the right
cannot be accessed.

00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:07.368
Then I opened the door to this room.

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:09.078
Thirty seconds remaining.

00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:12.373
By process of elimination, this room
and the one beside it can't be accessed.

00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:13.416
I'm sure of that.

00:38:13.499 --> 00:38:14.917
Ten seconds remaining.

00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:16.002
The answer is "Dead"!

00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:17.586
The "Alive" door is a trap!

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.922
Four, three, two…

00:38:20.006 --> 00:38:21.465
…one.

00:38:24.093 --> 00:38:26.220
The time limit for this room

00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:28.097
is one minute and twenty seconds.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.099
If your reasoning is right,
we're gonna survive!

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:31.851
You're awesome, Arisu!

00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:35.730
This game is not based on luck.
We need to clear it together!

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:36.981
According to my drawing,

00:38:37.064 --> 00:38:39.150
- the next is also "Dead".
- Let's do it!

00:38:39.233 --> 00:38:40.234
Ah!

00:38:42.403 --> 00:38:44.322
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

00:38:47.199 --> 00:38:49.327
Nice!

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:50.369
Yeah, we did it!

00:38:50.453 --> 00:38:52.705
- The time limit for this room…
- What's next? Huh? Huh?

00:38:52.788 --> 00:38:54.123
…is one minute
and ten seconds.

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.085
"Alive".

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.964
Let's go.

00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:09.013
- Hey, that hurts!
- Huh?

00:39:09.096 --> 00:39:11.182
The time limit for this room
is one minute.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.101
There's no door here.

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:16.312
- All right!
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

00:39:16.395 --> 00:39:18.230
- That hurts!
- Take this!

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:20.941
So what's next?

00:39:28.115 --> 00:39:29.950
Since that door
is out of the question,

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.577
should we choose one on the outer wall?

00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:35.748
Wait a second!

00:39:36.332 --> 00:39:39.335
- I might just have missed something.
- Fifty seconds remaining.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.756
The room we're in right now

00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:46.175
is on the left-end corner of the building.

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:49.512
The clearing condition
is to leave this building.

00:39:50.179 --> 00:39:52.890
That's why we'd feel we should
choose the "Dead" door to lead us out.

00:39:52.973 --> 00:39:56.060
But as I recall, there is no gap
between this and the adjoining building.

00:39:56.143 --> 00:39:58.729
The "Alive" door will lead us
to where the high school girl died.

00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:02.233
I don't know why there's no door
to connect to the back of the building.

00:40:03.275 --> 00:40:04.777
I must have overlooked something,

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.986
but what?

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:09.490
There shouldn't be any space left
for them to create a trap.

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:11.450
And if that's the case…

00:40:16.038 --> 00:40:18.290
We're wasting time! We're all gonna die!

00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:19.583
You haven't even opened a door!

00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:21.794
What are you even talking about?
Don't blame this on me!

00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:23.379
Stop it, you two!

00:40:23.462 --> 00:40:25.005
- Wait…
- Wait!

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:27.216
Chota, you took a video of the first room!

00:40:27.299 --> 00:40:28.968
There's no time for that!

00:40:29.051 --> 00:40:30.636
Thirty seconds remaining.

00:40:30.719 --> 00:40:32.138
I could've missed something.

00:40:32.221 --> 00:40:33.556
…doors to an art gallery.

00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:36.475
Which door do you think it is?

00:40:39.145 --> 00:40:40.146
Ah, fuck!

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:42.523
What'll happen if our time's up?

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:44.233
I can't take it,
I can't breathe!

00:40:49.488 --> 00:40:51.282
- There's no door!
- Huh?

00:40:51.365 --> 00:40:53.409
There's no door in the room
the girl entered!

00:40:53.492 --> 00:40:54.577
- What does that mean?
- There's a door here!

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.204
- Ten seconds remain.
- That means…

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.873
The room the high-school girl died
isn't next to us!

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.207
You mean what?

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:01.959
There's another room on the other side!

00:41:02.042 --> 00:41:04.837
Three, two, one.

00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:12.970
The time limit for this room
is ten seconds.

00:41:13.053 --> 00:41:14.180
Ten seconds?

00:41:14.263 --> 00:41:15.639
Are you kidding?

00:41:15.723 --> 00:41:17.349
It's not "Alive"! It's "Dead"!

00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:19.143
Don't open it, it's a trap!

00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:20.895
Five, four,

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:22.313
- three…
- Hurry!

00:41:22.396 --> 00:41:24.607
…two, one.

00:41:29.612 --> 00:41:32.281
Which way now?

00:41:32.364 --> 00:41:33.824
Head downstairs!

00:41:37.703 --> 00:41:39.288
C'mon, Chota. You can do it.

00:41:53.594 --> 00:41:55.346
Game cleared.

00:41:55.429 --> 00:41:56.263
GAME CLEARED

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:57.556
Congratulations.

00:42:01.227 --> 00:42:03.395
It's all thanks to you.

00:42:05.231 --> 00:42:06.607
Thank you.

00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:13.405
It's my karma.

00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:04.081
To the survivors of the game,
we will now supply you with a visa.

00:43:04.164 --> 00:43:07.293
{\an8}WE WILL SUPPLY ALL GAME SURVIVORS
WITH A 3-DAY VISA

00:43:08.168 --> 00:43:09.461
Visa?

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:25.019
I'm going to

00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:26.979
drop out of the game!

00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:33.444
Listen. There's no end to the game,
no matter how much you clear.

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:39.158
My visa just ended today.

00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:42.328
And now…

00:43:44.204 --> 00:43:45.998
I wish to play no longer.

00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:57.051
GM BUILDING

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:24.787
When your visa expires,

00:44:25.704 --> 00:44:27.665
you must return to the game or…

00:44:29.917 --> 00:44:32.252
Our visas will end too.

00:44:33.379 --> 00:44:34.630
We've got three days.

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:36.632
If you don't want to die,

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:39.426
you'll have to continue playing the game.

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:47.995
BASED ON THE ORIGINAL GRAPHIC NOVEL
ALICE IN BORDERLAND BY HARO ASO
