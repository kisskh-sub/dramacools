00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:17.058
Please wait until the game commences.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:20.437
Five minutes
until game registration closes.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.691
This time it's a Ferris wheel.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.653
Wonder what kind of game it is, huh?

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.116
Tonight, our visas will expire.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.370
We have to play it.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.416
Um, can I bother you for a sec?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.213
Have you… Have you
ever heard of the Beach?

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:48.757
What?

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.468
- Leave him alone, let's go.
- Wait!

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.526
Where the hell is this Beach?

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.112
Registration is now closed.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:13.031
The game will now commence.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.523
We still don't know where the Beach is.

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.360
And now, we're back here again.

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:43.204
If we don't join up in a game soon,
our visas will expire.

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:55.466
My visa expires in three days.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.433
Three days to go.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.895
But I'll find that Beach and…

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.315
I'll put an end to this damn game.

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:21.492
Tomorrow, I'll do a day hunt.
Wanna come with me?

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.245
Is that okay?

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.998
Can't promise I'll stay out of your way,
but I'll do my best.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.920
All the knowledge
that you've discovered about nature…

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.256
I need to learn, and learn right away.

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:40.053
Life comes with consequence.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.224
Without thinking about that,
somehow I've lived till now.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.478
Those guys trusted me.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.147
They died believing in me.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.069
I may also die soon, and for what?

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:58.863
For now…

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:02.492
I don't want to waste
even a single minute, not a second.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.791
Have a good night.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.822
Without the city lights hiding them…

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.242
the stars look beautiful.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.841
Damn!

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:04.595
Damn it!

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.977
I told you not to stay out there.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.439
It's okay, you can sleep in the tent.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.734
But… but, uh…

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.197
Your worst enemy's lack of sleep.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:27.201
Being alert and totally rested can make
the difference between life and death.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:00.943
Clearly, wild boars live here.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:04.322
This is a mud puddle.
It's where the boars bathe themselves.

00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:06.199
I also noticed…

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:10.161
that dug up soil
where they forage for leaf buds.

00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:12.538
Sharpen their claws on the tree stump.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.583
There are wild boars in Odaiba?

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:20.129
The humans are gone,
so the animals came back to the city.

00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:25.802
Rule one of hunting is
to look for footprints.

00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:29.597
The boundary lines
of an animal's territory

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.265
spreads out in a mesh pattern.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.521
To hunt, all you need to do is
connect those lines.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.982
Then you'll know
the comings and goings of your prey.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:45.822
In other words, know their playing field,
connect the lines.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:47.990
You learn quickly.

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.576
The video game Battleland follows
the same idea.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.328
Battleland?

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.455
Yeah, it's an online game.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.207
Online game?

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.126
You can play it online.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.128
Huh.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.020
What do you see?

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:21.065
{\an8}There are about ten participants
in the game.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:24.777
Don't know what's going on.
They seem to be forming a team.

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:25.903
What about you?

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:29.407
I see four people. I'll pretend
I'm joining the game and talk to them.

00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:31.492
Hey, wait a second.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.329
- What?
- Look at the participants' wrists.

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:36.789
Their wrists?

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.249
Any of yours wearing a locker key?

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.960
Like the ones you get in a fitness club.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.089
I saw them when we were playing tag.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.049
Here it is.

00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:53.389
They must've been on a team.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.516
Wait, I see…

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.478
I see two wearing them.

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:00.313
Keep your eye on them.

00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:02.190
Got it.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.327
The ones who cleared the game came out.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.204
I was right. They have locker keys.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:19.207
Over here, three people came out.
They split up and walked off.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.709
Two of them had locker keys,
they seem like they're together.

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:24.337
They're headed in the same direction.
I'll follow them.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.716
- It's over!
- Yeah!

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:30.593
- Let's go back.
- Let's get out of here!

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:32.470
Yeah, let's go!

00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:40.228
Usagi.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.647
Did you see that too?

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.440
It's definitely these guys.

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:48.069
I knew we were gonna win!
Come on, let's go!

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.656
They're getting into a car.

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:53.449
They might be collecting
all these old cars

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.992
as an organization.

00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:58.371
They're rolling!

00:08:58.454 --> 00:08:59.997
Mine are too!

00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:07.547
The car's headed for Maihama!

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.756
Mine too!

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:45.960
Is that it?

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.551
BEACH

00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:54.635
"Beach."

00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:57.096
That's it.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.557
How does it have electricity?

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.894
Will we find the answers
to our questions there?

00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:20.411
Good morning.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.748
I apologize for this rude introduction.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:28.002
Our sentries report
that there were people spying on us.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.338
Why are you here?

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:36.052
I was told that…

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.471
I could find answers here.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.474
What is this game?

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:44.810
And where is everybody?

00:10:49.857 --> 00:10:51.192
Where indeed.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:55.905
We have the answers
that you are looking for.

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:03.537
Welcome…

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:07.792
to the oasis known as the Beach.

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:17.927
Here is the first answer.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.504
Allow me to enlighten you.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.173
These cards…

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:59.885
These cards are the only way
to end your nightmare.

00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:05.683
To clear the game,
you must collect all the cards.

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:09.311
Collect all of the cards?

00:12:10.938 --> 00:12:12.732
If we collect all of the cards,

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.818
will the world we once knew return?

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.949
It's not the world that will return.

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.577
Only one person…

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.455
can return to the normal world.

00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:29.832
Huh?

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:31.751
Only one?

00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:37.923
It's impossible for one person
to clear all the games

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:40.176
and collect all 52 cards.

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:42.678
They could not do this alone.

00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:44.680
That's suicide.

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:47.892
That's why we've united as one

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:51.020
in order to allow one person to leave.

00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:54.356
That is the Beach's objective.

00:12:55.524 --> 00:13:00.321
You have been given good cards,
I've been told.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:05.326
From now on, let's play together.
United, as one,

00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:08.078
and collect the remaining cards together.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.332
If we say no?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.210
You can't say no.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.713
Your visa…

00:13:18.255 --> 00:13:19.882
expires today.

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:24.637
Seems like you have to join us, yeah?

00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:29.475
If we help you,
you're saying we can end the game?

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:32.228
Will this be over?

00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:35.606
Can't answer that for certain.

00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:38.484
But there are indications
that it's possible.

00:13:40.277 --> 00:13:44.740
Everyone in this room,
long before you entered the game,

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:47.827
has been searching this country.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:51.539
What do you mean… this "country"?

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:56.210
Visas have been issued, therefore,

00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:58.712
this is a country.

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:04.802
It seems that the people of Tokyo
haven't all disappeared like we have.

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:06.720
We wonder,

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:10.766
have we been transported somehow
to another country?

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:12.726
If we have,

00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:15.646
there must be a way to return.

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:21.777
So together, all of us built
this small organization.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:25.155
{\an8}Electricity is produced
from a fuel-powered generator.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.950
We use rainwater for our water supply.

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:31.370
We got our firearms
from the living and the dead.

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:36.458
However, only a select few of us
are allowed to use them.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:42.089
Our aim here is to unite and collect
all the cards together.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:44.592
And in this…

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:47.344
paradise, this Beach,

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:50.097
we only have three rules.

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:51.974
Rule one.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.102
Always wear a swimsuit wherever you go.

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:57.271
Why?

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:03.110
You can't conceal a weapon in a swimsuit,
so it's safe.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.362
Also, here,

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:08.908
you are free to drown in alcohol,
get high on drugs,

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.618
and have sex as much as you want.

00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:15.205
Enjoy your life while you still can.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:20.210
All keys and locks
have been destroyed and thrown away.

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:22.254
There are no secrets.

00:15:23.213 --> 00:15:24.423
Rule two.

00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:28.302
All cards are the Beach's property.

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:32.389
That means that all the cards
you've collected,

00:15:32.473 --> 00:15:34.975
we'll hang onto for safekeeping.

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:41.690
Those who have contributed their cards
will be promoted in numerical order.

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:47.029
You see, after our collective effort
sends out the first person,

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:52.534
it won't be long before we can gather
enough duplicate cards

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.621
to send out a second person,
then a third, and so on.

00:15:57.247 --> 00:16:00.751
The day when the Beach's brothers
and sisters can leave this country

00:16:00.834 --> 00:16:02.461
is fast approaching.

00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:07.883
And when exactly will that be?

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.097
What if…

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.933
I refuse to join?

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.612
Well, there's rule three.

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.700
The last one.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.872
Death to all traitors.

00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:49.717
People in this room
have sacrificed everything

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.471
to ensure a first departure
from the Beach one glorious day.

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:57.725
Soldiers in a great cause!

00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:03.272
To those who plot against us…

00:17:04.231 --> 00:17:06.525
Beach shows no mercy.

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:29.506
Usagi.

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:31.675
I'm sorry…

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:35.387
that I got you involved.

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:39.266
Don't apologize.

00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:42.519
I wanted to be involved.

00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:46.857
I knew what I was doing.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.804
The Seven of Hearts!

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:19.765
The cards are with us!

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:24.394
One of us is closer
to leaving this country.

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:25.646
We thank you.

00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:31.610
Rest assured that we will consider
promoting the two of you.

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:33.737
And now!

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:37.491
Enjoy the Beach and whatever you desire.

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.732
What the hell?

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:42.639
I feel like…

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:45.058
we're being watched.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.395
Newcomers are always
a spectacle to others.

00:20:00.782 --> 00:20:04.077
Yeah, let's get it going!

00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:07.497
Beach party! Get this blowout started!

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:10.792
Come on!

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.502
This is messed up.

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:16.131
Do you believe what we're seeing?

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:18.634
Hey, it's game time!

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:27.935
A new game arena
has been confirmed in Shinagawa!

00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:30.938
- The cars are in the second parking lot!
- Adachi and Koto wards,

00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.522
form two groups! Let's go!

00:20:33.857 --> 00:20:38.320
Hatter! Hatter! Hatter!
Hatter! Hatter! Hatter!

00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:43.659
Hatter! Hatter! Hatter!
Hatter! Hatter! Hatter!

00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:50.624
Comrades!

00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:53.293
Tonight brings us a new challenge.

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:57.047
And my soldiers never back down from one.

00:20:57.881 --> 00:21:01.134
This challenge is a war
against your own fear.

00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:04.554
Individually, each of you
has the courage within to play.

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:06.139
To battle and to win.

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:08.392
And when you stand united as one,

00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:11.144
nothing can stand in your way.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:15.357
Together, we will get the cards we need

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.151
to return us to our old world.

00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:20.153
I know

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:22.364
that you will get there!

00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:26.034
Let's do it!

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.374
Go to the car that has your number!

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:37.212
Is this what we are now? One of them?
Collecting cards?

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:39.840
We've been divided
into two separate games.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.426
Promise me you'll be careful?

00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:49.308
What's wrong?

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:52.936
We were together in the last game.

00:21:54.396 --> 00:21:56.773
- Who? Those two?
- Yeah.

00:21:57.774 --> 00:21:59.151
Maybe we can use them.

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.153
They could fit into the plan.

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:10.370
Team 1 to Team 9,
proceed to the game arena in Shinagawa.

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:13.123
Team 10 to Team 17,
head to the game arena in Koto.

00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:15.334
Team 18 to 24, please proceed…

00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:18.253
Game, "Jungle Beast Hunter".

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:21.673
{\an8}Work together to defeat the jungle beasts.

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:24.968
Refer to the scoreboard for point value.

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:39.358
Game, "Borrowed Time".

00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:41.318
Hang on!

00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:47.199
Game, "Human Elevator".

00:22:52.287 --> 00:22:55.499
Game, "Bingo Night at the Match Factory".

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.127
Use the eight matches provided

00:22:59.628 --> 00:23:03.298
to collect the numbers hidden
in the 24 rooms.

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:06.009
To clear the game, make a bingo.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.846
Out of the way! Out of the way!

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:13.558
WILD BOAR
50 POINTS RECEIVED

00:23:13.642 --> 00:23:14.684
EAGLE
30 POINTS RECEIVED

00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:53.640
Where is it?

00:24:08.822 --> 00:24:09.990
CROW
1 POINT RECEIVED

00:24:10.073 --> 00:24:11.783
Too easy!

00:24:14.327 --> 00:24:15.579
That's it.

00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:17.581
Room 4D is 9.

00:25:10.926 --> 00:25:14.888
1 PER PERSON

00:25:19.935 --> 00:25:22.062
This test will tell us
if you're a good candidate

00:25:22.145 --> 00:25:23.980
for a Beach executive post.

00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:26.441
So, do your best.

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:34.282
A waterproof cover?

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:39.746
I'm Kuina. Good to meet ya.

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.290
Me too.

00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:44.334
Ms. Ann!

00:25:44.918 --> 00:25:47.128
The water's coming out pretty fast,
it's getting deeper.

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:50.632
Hey, you!

00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:56.137
Wow, you played tag. You made it, huh?

00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:58.265
Yeah, now at the Beach, I'm a mechanic--

00:25:58.348 --> 00:26:00.350
You can talk when the game's over.

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:24.958
What is this game?

00:26:28.712 --> 00:26:31.047
Game entry is now closed.

00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:33.883
There are seven participants.

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:35.552
The game is about to commence.

00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:40.098
Difficulty, Four of Diamonds.

00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:41.016
GAME DIFFICULTY

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:43.476
This is the last Diamond we need.

00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:47.772
Game, "Light Bulb".

00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:49.774
"Light bulb"?

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:52.444
OPEN AND CLOSE FREELY

00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:58.074
Game play challenge.

00:26:58.158 --> 00:27:00.869
Which switch turns the light bulb on?

00:27:03.747 --> 00:27:05.624
WHICH SWITCH TURNS ON THE LIGHT BULB?

00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:07.042
Rule one.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:14.090
Only one of the switches, A, B, or C,
will turn the light bulb on.

00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:17.052
Rule two.

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:22.390
You only have one chance
to leave the door open

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:24.392
while flipping a switch.

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:29.564
When the door is closed,

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:33.318
you may flip any switch
or as many as you like.

00:27:34.944 --> 00:27:36.154
Rule three.

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:41.117
If a player is in the room
and the switch is flipped on,

00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:46.331
the door to the room will be locked
and cannot be reopened.

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:51.920
Participants have only one chance
to answer as a group.

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:57.342
The game is cleared when you determine
which switch turns the light bulb on.

00:27:57.425 --> 00:27:59.427
As the water level rises,

00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:02.222
should water touch
the hanging electrical wires,

00:28:02.305 --> 00:28:04.349
it is game over.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.309
Electrical wires?

00:28:12.232 --> 00:28:14.275
And those would be the electrical wires.

00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:17.278
Remember, don't touch.

00:28:19.072 --> 00:28:20.532
The water level is rising!

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:23.576
If it gets high enough, we'll all die.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.996
Okay, listen! We just need to know
which switch turns on the light.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.125
I'll go into the room first,
we'll take turns!

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:32.252
If you go in, the door won't close!

00:28:32.335 --> 00:28:33.878
Let's see…

00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:36.673
And you can only try once
with the door open.

00:28:36.756 --> 00:28:39.634
But if we close the door,
it doesn't make sense to flip a switch.

00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:40.969
We won't know if the light's on!

00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:44.723
Yes, but suppose we flip the A switch
with the door open,

00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:46.516
but the light bulb doesn't light.

00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:49.310
Then we'll only know
that it's not the A switch.

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:51.062
Well, have you got a better idea?

00:28:53.189 --> 00:28:56.359
I say that you… you flip the A switch
with the door open.

00:28:56.443 --> 00:28:58.111
And if the light bulb doesn't go on?

00:28:58.194 --> 00:29:01.239
If the light bulb turns on,
then it's switch A. If not, it's B or C.

00:29:01.322 --> 00:29:03.491
That way we've got a 50 percent chance!

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:05.285
66 percent.

00:29:06.745 --> 00:29:08.288
You sure? It should be 50 percent.

00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:11.082
Gotta tell you,
I'm not following any of this.

00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:13.543
What will you do, Arisu?

00:29:16.129 --> 00:29:17.505
There's no other choice.

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:20.592
All right, with the door open,
I'll flip the switch!

00:29:20.675 --> 00:29:22.010
If the light bulb doesn't light,

00:29:22.093 --> 00:29:24.345
we'll be left with choosing
between the other two switches.

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:25.764
So it's a shot in the dark?

00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:29.434
- It's all I've got.
- With seven people's lives.

00:29:33.396 --> 00:29:34.689
Sorry, six.

00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:38.526
Ann, if you know how to solve this,
then tell us!

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.821
I told you, Arisu. We are testing you.

00:29:43.364 --> 00:29:46.034
Give me a break!
Don't drag me into some rookie test.

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:47.243
Gonna give up?

00:29:47.327 --> 00:29:50.330
Well, I give up. Just tell me the answer!

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.292
We'll die! Tell him!

00:29:54.375 --> 00:29:56.503
The answer!

00:29:57.462 --> 00:30:00.173
Arisu, just do it before it's too late!

00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:02.801
I don't know how!

00:30:03.676 --> 00:30:06.387
Think it through, Arisu.

00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:13.686
- Go on, go on!
- What are you waiting for?

00:30:22.278 --> 00:30:24.280
You only have one chance

00:30:24.364 --> 00:30:27.116
- to leave the door open while…
- What would happen

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.577
if you flip the A switch
with the door open,

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:31.371
but the light bulb doesn't light?

00:30:31.454 --> 00:30:34.415
If the light bulb turns on,
then it's switch A. If not, it's B or C!

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:38.378
If the door is closed,
you may flip any switch.

00:30:39.712 --> 00:30:41.047
Close the door.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.173
Huh?

00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:45.385
Close the door! Hurry!

00:30:45.885 --> 00:30:48.721
I'd do what he says.
Otherwise, we're dead.

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:01.985
Don't move!

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.654
But why not?

00:31:04.737 --> 00:31:06.155
What are you doing?

00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:22.213
Hurry up!

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:25.341
Open it!

00:31:35.852 --> 00:31:37.228
Hurry up!

00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:44.569
It didn't light!

00:31:44.652 --> 00:31:46.863
Kuina! Go in and touch it!

00:31:46.946 --> 00:31:48.031
Huh?

00:31:48.114 --> 00:31:50.575
Go touch the bulb! Our time's running out.

00:31:53.786 --> 00:31:55.872
Get us out! Get us out!

00:31:57.874 --> 00:31:59.083
It's hot!

00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:01.544
- The answer is switch A--
- Switch A!

00:32:21.397 --> 00:32:25.151
Game cleared. Congratulations.

00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:34.744
The light bulb is incandescent.

00:32:34.827 --> 00:32:37.246
It stayed hot because it was on.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.457
If it was cold, it wasn't on.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.960
I threw the switch to confirm it.

00:32:42.543 --> 00:32:46.464
That raised the odds
from 66 percent to 100 percent.

00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:53.346
It should've been 50 percent.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.473
I don't care anymore.

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:28.464
You made it.

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:30.133
Mm-hm.

00:33:35.972 --> 00:33:38.266
Ann knew the answer the whole time.

00:33:41.394 --> 00:33:43.855
They were… testing me.

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:47.525
When in Rome, do as the Romans do, right?

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:53.948
Is she your girlfriend?

00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:56.868
What? No, I'm not.

00:33:57.452 --> 00:33:59.746
If you two like each other,
why not hook up?

00:34:00.496 --> 00:34:02.915
You guys could die tomorrow.

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:04.250
What's it to you?

00:34:04.333 --> 00:34:06.169
You should live while you're alive.

00:34:10.423 --> 00:34:12.425
My mother is stuck in a hospital.

00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:16.179
She can't even go to the toilet
by herself.

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.181
And I wound up here.

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:21.476
That's why I need to survive and go home.

00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:24.896
And that's the reason I quit smoking.

00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:28.357
Back in the day, I couldn't stop smoking.

00:34:29.484 --> 00:34:31.819
But to survive the game,
you need to stay healthy.

00:34:33.988 --> 00:34:36.908
I absolutely need to survive
and go back to my other world.

00:34:36.991 --> 00:34:40.453
Hey! Stop that crap music.

00:34:52.298 --> 00:34:54.801
They're the militant corps at the Beach.

00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:57.929
If you want to live in peace here,

00:34:58.012 --> 00:34:59.931
then do not mess with them.

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:06.354
General Aguni is
an ex-Special Forces officer.

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.731
He controls all of the weapons
at the beach.

00:35:10.525 --> 00:35:12.985
The person who commands the beach
right now

00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:15.404
is the number one Hatter and his lackeys.

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:19.700
As well as the militants led by Aguni.

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:24.205
Right now, law and order at the Beach is
very fragile.

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:27.208
Both of these groups could clash
at any time.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.303
Where's your friend?

00:35:46.435 --> 00:35:48.187
Oh, yeah? He's dead?

00:35:49.313 --> 00:35:50.565
Too bad.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.401
Yet someone like you still lives.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:56.154
You know each other?

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.034
Hey.

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:04.579
Bring the woman.

00:36:05.413 --> 00:36:06.706
You got it.

00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:10.042
- Whoa!
- You crazy? Don't get involved.

00:36:11.127 --> 00:36:13.588
My boss says to bring you to him.

00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:16.841
Get up.

00:36:17.466 --> 00:36:18.509
Leave her.

00:36:20.219 --> 00:36:23.014
Are you a tough guy?
What should I do with him?

00:36:23.598 --> 00:36:26.309
Break both his legs
so he dies in the next game.

00:36:26.976 --> 00:36:28.561
Good one. Hey!

00:36:28.644 --> 00:36:30.271
Take the woman.

00:36:31.147 --> 00:36:32.773
And you, come with me.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.401
Come on, let's go.

00:36:38.446 --> 00:36:39.447
Huh?

00:36:42.283 --> 00:36:43.826
Aw.

00:36:45.286 --> 00:36:46.579
Is there a problem?

00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:55.463
Back off, Hatter.
This is none of your business.

00:36:57.089 --> 00:36:59.050
But this business is mine.

00:36:59.967 --> 00:37:04.055
I am the Beach's leader.
What I say is the law here.

00:37:06.515 --> 00:37:08.476
And I'm saying…

00:37:09.143 --> 00:37:13.439
that you will keep your hands
off the newcomers, Aguni.

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.490
Niragi?

00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:27.954
The only boss I have is the general.

00:37:37.004 --> 00:37:39.465
Then I will ask the general.

00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:45.972
Who do you think is your boss, then,

00:37:46.555 --> 00:37:47.807
Aguni?

00:38:03.656 --> 00:38:05.241
I know it is you.

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:15.293
Shower once in a while.

00:38:16.043 --> 00:38:18.838
Executive members!
Meeting in the conference room.

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.680
Arisu, you too.

00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:32.435
Ann told me you have potential.

00:38:33.769 --> 00:38:34.812
Come with us.

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.030
I better go.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.086
So?

00:38:59.712 --> 00:39:01.839
How was he? Is he good?

00:39:03.924 --> 00:39:05.176
He was great.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.388
All right, let's start the meeting.

00:39:09.472 --> 00:39:12.141
If you're not an executive member,
leave the room.

00:39:33.329 --> 00:39:34.455
Hi.

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:37.083
We took the Two of Spades.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.253
Six of Spades. Four of Diamonds.

00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:43.839
And the Two of Clubs.

00:39:45.257 --> 00:39:49.637
So far, the existence of any face cards
has not been confirmed.

00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:51.889
If there are no face cards,

00:39:51.972 --> 00:39:53.933
then only the Ten of Hearts remains.

00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:56.977
The Ten of Hearts.

00:39:57.686 --> 00:40:00.439
It hasn't appeared in any game yet.

00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:07.530
If the Ten of Hearts hasn't appeared yet,

00:40:08.114 --> 00:40:10.408
then maybe there's a reason for it.

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:13.035
Perhaps it's not in Tokyo.

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:16.580
No game arena has been found
outside the 23 districts.

00:40:16.664 --> 00:40:19.166
That only means
we haven't searched far enough.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.709
We're not changing the plan.

00:40:22.711 --> 00:40:26.090
The search for the other game arenas
in Tokyo will continue.

00:40:26.173 --> 00:40:27.633
Keep an eye on visa expirations.

00:40:27.716 --> 00:40:29.802
Let's wait for the Ten of Hearts
to show up.

00:40:31.637 --> 00:40:34.348
My visa needs to be reissued soon.

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:43.441
Respectfully,

00:40:44.066 --> 00:40:46.402
there is a way to earn a visa.

00:40:47.403 --> 00:40:48.279
Oh?

00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:51.657
A Hearts game…

00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:56.036
is a game that plays
with people's minds and emotions.

00:40:57.246 --> 00:40:59.582
We use a decoy we know will die

00:41:00.332 --> 00:41:02.793
and fix the game so that you survive.

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:08.340
Arisu cleared the Seven of Hearts game.

00:41:09.175 --> 00:41:10.759
I guess that means…

00:41:11.635 --> 00:41:14.972
If he can do it, then anyone can!

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.393
Arisu, you cleared the Seven of Hearts?

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:21.270
Can you give us any advice?

00:41:26.525 --> 00:41:29.737
There's no way to predict
when a Hearts game may appear.

00:41:30.237 --> 00:41:33.365
Don't forget, we only find out
what the game is

00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:35.201
after registration closes.

00:41:35.284 --> 00:41:38.787
True, but the theory of probability
should help us determine the arena.

00:41:40.414 --> 00:41:43.125
I don't need pretentious theories.

00:41:44.793 --> 00:41:46.921
I will participate in the next game.

00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:49.924
I don't care if it's a Heart or a Spade.

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:52.635
I can clear them all!

00:41:53.636 --> 00:41:56.347
And I'll be there
when the Ten of Hearts appears.

00:41:57.181 --> 00:42:00.726
The cards are on the table.
Our day of departure is near!

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:06.690
Executives, you're in charge
while I'm away.

00:42:09.902 --> 00:42:10.986
Meeting adjourned!

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:56.282
Mwah.

00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:00.244
Arisu, have a drink.

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:09.670
I always like to have a little fun
before a game.

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:20.723
What do you think? That I'd poison you?

00:43:26.145 --> 00:43:27.062
Hmm?

00:43:27.855 --> 00:43:28.897
Mm.

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:31.400
Is that proof enough?

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.320
You really don't trust me, do you?

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:42.786
You're a cautious young man. I like that.

00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:46.457
What did you use to do
in the normal world?

00:43:49.084 --> 00:43:52.630
- Nothing.
- Mmm. Nerd, yeah?

00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:59.762
Me? I used to run
a men's club in Kabukicho.

00:44:00.888 --> 00:44:03.974
"Beach" was its name.

00:44:04.058 --> 00:44:05.476
Ever hear of it?

00:44:07.394 --> 00:44:09.605
It was the place to go!

00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:21.408
That radio commercial was playing
all the time.

00:44:22.534 --> 00:44:24.078
I was gaming all the time.

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:25.162
Ah.

00:44:34.463 --> 00:44:35.589
What I wanted…

00:44:38.592 --> 00:44:41.136
was to be the best in Kabukicho.

00:44:43.305 --> 00:44:45.391
So desperate.

00:44:54.441 --> 00:44:56.860
My men and I were always saying,

00:44:57.569 --> 00:45:01.031
"We're gonna take over this city!"

00:45:08.414 --> 00:45:10.165
As a host, it's all over.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.545
If you're looked down on
by your customers,

00:45:16.505 --> 00:45:18.674
then you go back home alone.

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:25.597
"You can never, ever,
stop being proud of yourself."

00:45:27.766 --> 00:45:30.978
That's what I always said to my men.

00:45:35.357 --> 00:45:37.526
Even so…

00:45:41.196 --> 00:45:43.824
…one of my men lost his pride one night.

00:45:48.328 --> 00:45:49.455
He went home…

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.960
and hanged himself.

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:06.847
They all left me.

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:12.978
I wanted…

00:46:16.815 --> 00:46:19.568
I wanted to rule the place with them.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.660
Now that I think about it,

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:34.124
his death was a necessary evil.

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:39.671
You see, it made me that much stronger.

00:46:42.049 --> 00:46:43.425
Stronger?

00:46:47.429 --> 00:46:49.640
At this new Beach,

00:46:50.557 --> 00:46:54.019
all the players are devoted to me.

00:46:54.102 --> 00:46:56.063
They would die for me!

00:46:58.857 --> 00:47:01.777
They have made me their number one.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.825
When I finally escape from this country,

00:47:07.908 --> 00:47:10.035
I will be their hero!

00:47:14.289 --> 00:47:16.291
The hero, Hatter.

00:47:32.599 --> 00:47:34.476
But to have a hero,

00:47:35.811 --> 00:47:37.729
you need to have a tragedy.

00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:48.866
To the new Beach.
