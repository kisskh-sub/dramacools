00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.190
Goodbye.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:39.600
Hai Xing.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.360
I'm Mai Jiamin now.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.800
Thank you.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.390
If you hadn't helped me three years ago,

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.970
I couldn't have escaped from Nanzhou.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.670
Then why didn't you take me with you?

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.110
I was on the run.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.250
You couldn't have endured that hardship.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.800
Don't push all the blame onto me.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.840
Isn't it because your affairs

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.840
were always more important than me?

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.880
Just tell me,

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.760
how do you want me to help you this time?

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.520
I need a place

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.390
to do something.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.710
Make meth.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:44.430
You've got your eye on my drug store,

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:45.350
haven't you?

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.680
I'm a pharmacist.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:50.640
I can...

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.810
How long have you been stalking me?

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.160
You came back just to use me, didn't you?

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.190
In Nanzhou,

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.340
I have no one I can trust

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:33.050
except you.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.380
I know you're with someone else now,

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.180
and I know you're not happy about it.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.190
It's OK.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.230
I won't bother you again after this.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.280
I'll give you the drug store.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.400
But you need to understand that

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.440
this isn't about love.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.860
It's business.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.160
You're awake.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.350
Using the same trick twice

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.760
doesn't work anymore,

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.510
does it?

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:17.280
Mou, let me ask you.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.540
Are you and that drug maker

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.070
related by blood?

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:25.920
He must be hiding among these people

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.700
who donated blood to you.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:30.540
I don't know.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.340
Who are you talking about?

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.950
I don't know.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.000
I don't care what message

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.410
you're trying to send by hurting yourself.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:41.920
Let me be clear with you.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.760
It's useless.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.590
You don't know?

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:45.150
Fine.

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:47.700
But you should know that

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.650
if the goods aren't delivered,

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:51.870
the buyers won't let it go.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.200
You and your family are in danger.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.350
You'd better cooperate with us.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:02.550
I demand protection for my family.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.450
Then I'll tell you.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.380
I'll tell you everything.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.970
Is that all you want?

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.600
That can be arranged.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.920
Just cooperate with us.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.520
Tell us everything you know,

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.650
and the police will protect them well.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.890
So you hurt yourself

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.510
for such a simple reason.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:31.000
My family is innocent.
