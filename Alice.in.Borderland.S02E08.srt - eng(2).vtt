00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.733
Allow me to introduce my game to you.

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:11.863
This game,
the one that we're all about to play,

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:13.281
is called…

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:15.325
…The Queen of Croquet!

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:17.911
Croquet?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.997
Lawn billiards
is what they used to call it

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.209
in 19th-century England,
at the height of its popularity.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.338
I don't believe that it was ever
quite so popular in Japan.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:30.965
We don't know the rules.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.928
That's all right.
You don't really need to.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.013
Don't worry.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.725
It doesn't matter which one of us wins!

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.352
What?

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:45.939
Clearing Croquet is simple.

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:47.357
You just have to complete

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.693
three little sets of croquet games
without withdrawing.

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.239
If you decide to give up, game over.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:56.074
Weapons are also allowed here.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.159
It's so simple.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:01.371
Just three little rounds of croquet.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.293
W-- We just have to finish three rounds?

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.171
We don't even have to win?

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.632
Exactly! Simple, huh?

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:17.846
Now, why don't we begin?

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.715
Each side has two balls,

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:38.384
one blue and black,
the other red and yellow.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:42.805
To win, you need to pass your balls
through the six hoops in a certain order,

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.643
then hit the final finishing peg
before your opponent does.

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:17.006
Yes!

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:27.016
The first set's mine.
Better luck next time.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:33.356
We clear the game
by finishing three sets without quitting.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.025
I'm not gonna forfeit.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.861
There are two sets left.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.698
What is she thinking?

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.664
All right, round two now.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:14.522
It looks like she's dragging
the game out, making it last.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.109
I think she's playing with us.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.278
I need to get a move on.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.715
Oh! This is so much fun!

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.845
Lovely!

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.140
At this rate, we'll be playing forever.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.120
All right!

00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:44.904
I did it!

00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:45.863
I won!

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:53.204
It looks like I lost the second set.

00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:55.498
You are really talented!

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.876
Okay, time for round three.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.211
Hmm…

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.797
That was just exhausting.

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.675
What say we have some tea, hmm?

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.510
Tea?

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.730
Forget about the tea.
Let's play the game.

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:22.942
But teatime is tradition.

00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:25.319
It's proper croquet etiquette.

00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:28.656
Now, please, help yourselves.

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.463
When this game is over,

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.090
will we return to our world?

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:50.136
You'll find out
at the end of the game.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.306
Don't talk to her, Arisu.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.392
Don't pay any attention to her.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.477
Remember.

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:00.146
We just need to finish.

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:03.149
Why do you want to know so badly?

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.030
My best friends died.

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.491
They never got to learn the truth.

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:16.621
So I need to find out.
I'm doing it for their sake.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.625
- That's why I made it this far.
- You want to know.

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:23.669
But you also want to return

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.588
to your world.

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.964
Can we return?

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.093
Aww…

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.430
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:38.935
For all you know,

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.271
this could be the ruins
of your original world.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:44.815
See, you say that.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.568
But I bet you don't know anything either.

00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:49.946
Yes, I do.

00:08:55.117 --> 00:08:56.202
Hmm.

00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.455
I guess I have no choice.

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:02.875
If you want to know so bad,

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:05.670
then I'll tell you everything.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:09.048
The whole truth about where we are.

00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:21.477
However, when I start,
there's no going back.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.939
Remember that you had to know the answer.

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.901
You asked for this, Arisu.

00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:37.702
Tell me, have you ever thought…

00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:40.288
pictured what the future would be like?

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.748
- Future?
- Yes.

00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:46.502
Nanotechnology and renewable energy,

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:51.048
pluripotent cells, virtual reality,
cryogenics, terraforming.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:55.720
The science and technology from your era

00:09:55.803 --> 00:09:58.931
bursts with mountains
of hope and potential.

00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:03.019
Perhaps you should be celebrating,

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:06.105
because all of those things
became a reality.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:11.193
What's more, technology
rapidly advanced and progressed.

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:15.740
Within 30 years, the economies
of developing countries grew,

00:10:15.823 --> 00:10:19.869
and the inequality of living standards
was eventually eliminated.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:24.707
Fifty years later, gene manipulation
extended the human lifespan.

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:27.126
Wait a second.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.087
What are you saying?

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:34.008
What are you saying?

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:38.179
I am simply providing information.

00:10:40.097 --> 00:10:44.226
I'm telling you about
1,000 years of human history.

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:47.605
A thousand years?

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:49.857
In the future?

00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:54.820
After humanity
acquired more advanced knowledge,

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:58.658
it persisted in making
new discoveries in every field.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.118
And so, in short,

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:04.955
approximately ten years after
what you believe is the current year,

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:08.084
virtual reality and avatars

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:11.629
begin to take over
all aspects of people's lives.

00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:15.633
After 50 years, cures for dementia,
cancer, and many other maladies

00:11:15.716 --> 00:11:17.677
become possible through genetics.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.888
After a hundred,
natural disasters are eliminated

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:23.766
thanks to environmental
and weather control technologies.

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:27.561
After 200 years,
the mechanism of the brain is analyzed.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:30.272
Memories and thoughts can be transplanted.

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:34.151
After 300, humanity
finally conquers natural death

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.779
and extends their lifespan to 300 years.

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:41.075
After 400,
due to a perfect understanding of physics,

00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:43.994
humanity unlocks all laws of causality.

00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:46.330
Coincidence and fate are no more.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:50.710
After 500,
there are no irregular occurrences.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.547
Humankind is perfectly able
to control its whole world,

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.716
basically becoming immortal.

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:02.012
In the 500 years that follow, as long
as they are supplied with dopamine,

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:03.806
humans can live forever.

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.058
That's the world in 1,000 years.

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:09.497
Right now, you are playing
this game within a virtual reality.

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:13.375
You are so deeply immersed
that you've forgotten.

00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:19.590
This particular simulation is
the most popular virtual reality package

00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:21.550
a thousand years in the future.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:26.514
After more or less achieving eternal life,
people started losing their drive to live.

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:30.935
And yet, we were enamored with
the period of time a thousand years ago.

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:34.230
A time when people feared death
and the end of the world.

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.065
It continued to fascinate us.

00:13:40.277 --> 00:13:41.654
Oh, and…

00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:44.406
I'm the administrator of this system.

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:54.041
I'm just joking.

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:55.626
Not a word was true.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.878
Huh?

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.714
Just quit fucking around.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.301
This is the truth.

00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:11.100
Genetically modified plants developed
sudden mutations and exploded with growth.

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:14.019
I'm sure you must have noticed.

00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:15.771
The city?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.233
It's completely overrun with vegetation.

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:22.111
What's more,

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:25.364
the mountains surround us and close us in.

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:34.123
All of that was the work of aliens.

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:37.334
Aliens?

00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:41.422
They captured all of humanity
and wiped our memories.

00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:43.757
Forced us to play countless games.

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:47.052
All so they could conduct
behavioral experiments on us.

00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:48.929
Is that…

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:50.848
Is that true?

00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:54.435
Of course it is.

00:14:55.769 --> 00:14:56.770
Except

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.399
a rumor started circulating
among the players.

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:03.444
The ones forced to compete in the games.

00:15:03.527 --> 00:15:05.946
A rumor that that wasn't the whole story.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.741
A nuclear apocalypse
had wiped out most life,

00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:10.951
and the wealthy elite living underground

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:14.038
had created androids
with artificial memories.

00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:17.374
These androids compete in games
on the surface,

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:20.711
and the wealthy place bets
on who would survive.

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.845
A real nail biter,
wouldn't you agree, sir?

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:33.432
Miss? Excuse me.

00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:36.477
- Can I place a bet?
- Yes, of course.

00:15:36.977 --> 00:15:39.730
The players believe
that they are humans,

00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:42.983
being forced by aliens
to play these games.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.361
But actually, they…

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:48.238
and you

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:50.908
are simply androids with a collection

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:54.036
of artificial memories.

00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:57.164
So is that actually the truth?

00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:01.377
No! Just kidding.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.213
We need to finish one more set.

00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:06.882
Don't listen to what she's saying.

00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:10.177
You don't even know
the real answer, do you?

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.682
You just might be right.

00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:20.062
Do you want the truth so badly?

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:25.693
You want the truth
for the sake of your dead friends?

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.326
Oh, you poor, poor thing.

00:16:35.619 --> 00:16:37.830
It's written all over your face.

00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:42.251
They were tremendously important to you,
weren't they?

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.216
You should know,

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:52.469
I'm the one who made that game for you.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.974
I designed the Seven of Hearts
because you three were so close.

00:16:59.768 --> 00:17:00.894
Arisu!

00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:02.771
It's all right.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.481
Please don't stop him.

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:06.817
Let him hate.

00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:09.987
Hate is the most incredible motivator.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.139
It's all part of your plan, isn't it?

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:44.897
You want to get killed.

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.608
I'm supposed to shoot you now.

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:50.903
If I kill you in this game,

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:53.489
we won't win.

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:54.990
We won't clear it.

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.825
There won't even be a game over.

00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:58.786
That means

00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:02.039
I would make this game go on forever.

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:04.541
If that happens,

00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:09.338
all the other players are doomed
to wait until their visas expire.

00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:13.425
You want that.

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:16.553
You want us to fall into despair.

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.223
You want us to lose all hope.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.315
Tell me something.

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:30.984
While you were playing the games,

00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:35.030
did you really care
about the rest of the world?

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:40.202
Were you thinking about how
the world works or what its purpose is?

00:18:40.994 --> 00:18:42.371
Your own goals?

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:45.082
Or did you lose interest? Huh?

00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:48.335
Did you start to accept
that it didn't matter?

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.132
The answer doesn't matter.

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:56.009
And I think you know that.

00:18:57.386 --> 00:19:00.556
Arisu. Don't listen to her.

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:02.391
- I wanna know the answer.
- Arisu!

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:03.892
Are you really sure?

00:19:07.187 --> 00:19:08.063
Yeah.

00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:17.322
It seems like you're prepared
to accept reality.

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:24.621
So be it, then.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:29.501
I'll stop dodging your questions
and tell you what you want to know.

00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:33.714
Let's start with the big one.

00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:38.010
The world,
this world in front of your face,

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:39.928
none of it is real.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:41.930
It's an illusion.

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:49.146
You want me to believe
all of this is a trick?

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.525
Arisu, were you never once suspicious
since you arrived?

00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:57.446
The desolate city,
and the science far too advanced?

00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:58.989
The mysterious games?

00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:00.616
Is it humans, or aliens?

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:02.701
That doesn't make any sense, does it?

00:20:02.784 --> 00:20:06.580
Even if they were behind all this,
why would they choose to run these games?

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:11.251
Tag, hide-and-seek,

00:20:11.835 --> 00:20:13.587
they're children's games.

00:20:14.087 --> 00:20:17.674
Nothing beyond your imagination
is possible here.

00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:28.435
It is no surprise that you were right.

00:20:28.518 --> 00:20:31.104
You were always meant
to survive this long.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.524
It's simple, really.

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.987
This is all taking place in your mind.

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.698
This is all in your head, you see.

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:45.369
In a brain
that barely weighs 1,500 grams.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:03.971
Arisu.

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.139
Don't listen to her.

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:08.850
If this were an illusion,

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:11.395
that means I'm not real.

00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:15.274
I can't just be something you invented!
Listen, I'm alive and I'm here!

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:17.276
Of course you are.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.862
You exist, all right. Of course you do.

00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:23.532
But you're somewhere else.

00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:27.077
That is not the reality
Arisu is looking at right now.

00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:28.745
Huh?

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:31.665
Arisu.

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:35.752
What happened in that moment?

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:38.380
You remember, don't you?

00:21:42.342 --> 00:21:43.760
When you lost them.

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.889
Those friends
that were so precious to you.

00:21:49.683 --> 00:21:50.892
The shock of it

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.562
wiped your memories.

00:21:58.025 --> 00:21:59.318
I'm your doctor.

00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:02.487
My name is Mira Kano.

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:04.114
Remember me?

00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:06.325
Your psychiatrist.

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:09.286
I'm helping you.

00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:11.997
We are doing therapy together.

00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:16.335
You just

00:22:17.794 --> 00:22:19.338
don't remember.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.300
You don't remember anything.

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:30.891
So?

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.603
What about now?

00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:38.273
Your memories…

00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:42.027
Are they coming back?

00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:36.706
Arisu, how are you?

00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:41.753
Tell me about your memories.

00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:43.296
Are they coming back to you?

00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:50.387
Chota.

00:23:51.638 --> 00:23:52.722
Karube.

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:05.986
You're both two peas in a pod.

00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:09.156
She's always checking in.

00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:13.285
She really worries about you.

00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:20.542
She also lost
someone very precious to her.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.629
So she's been hospitalized here.
Just like you.

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.095
Now,

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:33.972
tell me.

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:39.853
Tell me what happened to you, Arisu.

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:44.357
On that day with the fireworks.

00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:51.990
Go on.

00:24:53.408 --> 00:24:54.618
Try to remember.

00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:00.957
Fireworks…

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.587
- Whoa! Get off!
- Put me down.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.172
- Quick!
- You guys are crazy!

00:25:10.717 --> 00:25:12.511
Watch out! Watch out!

00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:14.346
- Hurry up! Come on!
- Aah! Uh, uh--

00:25:14.429 --> 00:25:15.597
Look! Fireworks!

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.724
- Okay.
- Run for your lives!

00:25:21.895 --> 00:25:23.897
Huh? Huh? Huh?

00:25:24.731 --> 00:25:26.399
Huh? Huh…

00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:54.886
It was my fault.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.098
And now they're dead.

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:01.726
It seems like you remember now.

00:26:07.107 --> 00:26:08.733
I'm the one who killed them.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.152
My fault…

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:14.864
The answer you're trying to find,

00:26:16.199 --> 00:26:17.993
it's not about this world.

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.537
Why it exists.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.624
The answer you're really searching for

00:26:26.459 --> 00:26:28.461
is what you are.

00:26:29.796 --> 00:26:32.257
You want to know why you're alive.

00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:35.427
Why you lived.

00:26:36.303 --> 00:26:38.346
You want to know why you exist.

00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:44.477
You grew up starved for love.

00:26:46.396 --> 00:26:48.815
You've been seeking that answer
a long time.

00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:53.028
Long before you came here.

00:26:57.073 --> 00:26:58.408
So what did you do?

00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:01.911
You manifested these games

00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:03.913
in your fantasies,

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:07.125
these childlike games
you made for yourself.

00:27:15.383 --> 00:27:17.719
And as you kept surviving the games,

00:27:18.386 --> 00:27:19.638
you developed the desire

00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:22.307
to know the truth about this place.

00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:28.104
And that overlapped with your search
for meaning in your own life.

00:27:29.105 --> 00:27:31.107
They became intertwined in your head.

00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:37.030
Tell me, Arisu…

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.867
in this whole world,

00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:43.620
is there anyone who needs you?

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.875
I'm not sure I'm ready.

00:27:49.918 --> 00:27:52.128
Don't be silly.
You've prepared, haven't you?

00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:53.463
- I have, but I--
- Mm-hmm.

00:27:53.546 --> 00:27:56.049
I just…
I don't know how much…

00:27:57.676 --> 00:28:00.970
Is there a reason
you exist in this world?

00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:03.223
I've never had any concerns
about you, son.

00:28:03.306 --> 00:28:05.517
Does your life have any meaning?

00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:21.741
What's your life's purpose, son?

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:30.417
How long are you going
to pass your days like this?

00:28:35.922 --> 00:28:36.798
Hey.

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:40.969
Is there a reason you're alive?

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:45.598
And now

00:28:46.474 --> 00:28:48.435
you're the one who survived.

00:28:55.775 --> 00:28:57.026
I don't know why.

00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:00.739
There's no reason for me to live.

00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:06.578
They're the ones

00:29:07.954 --> 00:29:09.664
who should have survived.

00:29:13.877 --> 00:29:14.878
Karube.

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:17.714
Chota.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.052
Instead, it's me.

00:29:25.054 --> 00:29:27.640
I survived. The one with no reason to.

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:37.484
I shouldn't be alive at all.

00:29:45.825 --> 00:29:46.910
Arisu.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.496
You need to wait outside for your turn.

00:29:50.497 --> 00:29:51.831
We'll be seeing you soon.

00:29:53.917 --> 00:29:55.835
- Arisu!
- Leave him alone.

00:29:56.795 --> 00:30:00.048
He is trying to remember everything
right now.

00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:03.968
Hey, hey! Wake up!

00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:05.720
- Hey!
- I said stop that!

00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:13.019
Arisu's remembering his past
so that he can recover.

00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:15.647
And you're interfering with that.

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.566
- No!
- Step back.

00:30:23.363 --> 00:30:24.447
Now,

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.866
Arisu…

00:30:30.245 --> 00:30:31.913
why don't we make this go away?

00:30:34.165 --> 00:30:37.293
All you need to do
is tell me that you're giving up…

00:30:40.129 --> 00:30:41.673
and the game will end.

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:47.762
The game will… end.

00:30:54.727 --> 00:30:56.271
That means it's real.

00:30:57.313 --> 00:30:59.148
It wasn't an illusion.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.492
I was a player in that game too.

00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:32.015
Now,

00:31:32.932 --> 00:31:33.892
Arisu.

00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:39.731
Let me be absolutely certain.

00:31:42.108 --> 00:31:43.359
You're forfeiting?

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.196
You're quitting the game, right?

00:32:09.636 --> 00:32:12.221
You'll feel better
after you take your medicine.

00:32:15.141 --> 00:32:16.142
Go on.

00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:25.193
After that,

00:32:26.736 --> 00:32:27.904
you can answer.

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:48.758
Arisu, stop it.

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:53.554
Arisu, no!

00:33:09.278 --> 00:33:10.822
I would put that down.

00:33:17.245 --> 00:33:18.538
Arisu…

00:33:23.042 --> 00:33:24.711
you promised.

00:33:26.045 --> 00:33:29.549
You promised you'd protect me,
no matter what.

00:33:34.387 --> 00:33:35.888
Don't listen to her.

00:33:37.223 --> 00:33:39.350
I am definitely here with you.

00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:42.979
I'm alive!

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:50.319
But if you believe what she says…

00:33:54.907 --> 00:33:57.118
then our time together wasn't real.

00:34:00.246 --> 00:34:02.832
It was just something
you created in your mind.

00:34:08.254 --> 00:34:10.381
And if you made it all up, then…

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.763
then that means I don't matter to you.

00:34:18.347 --> 00:34:20.099
And what I do shouldn't affect you.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.692
Arisu!

00:34:31.277 --> 00:34:32.528
Wake up.

00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:21.721
Arisu.

00:36:31.397 --> 00:36:32.523
Arisu.

00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:35.693
You have to come back.

00:36:37.737 --> 00:36:39.864
Please.

00:36:45.953 --> 00:36:48.706
What a truly touching display.

00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:51.083
However,

00:36:52.627 --> 00:36:55.838
the feeling you call love is powerless.

00:37:01.928 --> 00:37:03.054
Arisu.

00:37:06.474 --> 00:37:07.308
Please.

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:10.853
I shouldn't be here.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.940
I shouldn't be alive.

00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:17.693
I have no reason to live.

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.374
Come back…

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:35.962
Arisu.

00:37:46.973 --> 00:37:49.517
The answer you're looking for…

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.813
a reason to be alive…

00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:00.361
Forget all of it, Arisu.

00:38:06.367 --> 00:38:08.077
The-- the truth is

00:38:09.245 --> 00:38:11.163
everyone has a different answer.

00:38:13.916 --> 00:38:15.793
It doesn't matter now.

00:38:17.878 --> 00:38:19.213
You-- you don't need

00:38:20.172 --> 00:38:21.924
a-- a reason to live.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.473
This whole time
that we were looking for answers…

00:38:32.018 --> 00:38:34.270
…we've been searching side by side.

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:43.446
That alone was all I needed.

00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:46.949
That was enough.

00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:58.753
You helped me realize what was important.

00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:04.884
It was you.

00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:10.348
It was you, Arisu.

00:39:47.176 --> 00:39:49.345
You poor thing.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.645
Looks like I've won.

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:07.613
You'll be forfeiting now.

00:40:09.448 --> 00:40:11.117
Isn't that right, Arisu?

00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:27.425
And then…

00:40:29.051 --> 00:40:31.011
…our game will be over.

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:18.934
Usagi.

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:28.110
Usagi…

00:41:30.237 --> 00:41:32.156
I want to feel your hand.

00:41:34.783 --> 00:41:36.410
Just one more time.

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:43.959
Walk side by side.

00:41:45.544 --> 00:41:46.754
One more time.

00:41:53.093 --> 00:41:55.137
And I want to eat next to you.

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:02.978
Me too.

00:42:15.115 --> 00:42:16.200
Tomorrow…

00:42:21.914 --> 00:42:23.123
I just want…

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:27.878
to say good morning to you.

00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:34.260
I want to laugh with you every single day.

00:42:37.012 --> 00:42:38.305
And some day…

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:44.353
I want us to climb a mountain.

00:42:46.313 --> 00:42:47.773
Just being with you…

00:42:50.025 --> 00:42:52.528
that's more than enough, Usagi.

00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:56.782
We may fight.

00:42:59.952 --> 00:43:02.538
But some days, that might be nice.

00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:08.919
I want you to live.

00:43:12.172 --> 00:43:13.591
I want that.

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:33.944
I want to keep protecting you.

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:54.965
Game on.

00:43:57.718 --> 00:43:58.844
Last round.

00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:51.939
Arisu.

00:44:53.232 --> 00:44:54.400
It's okay now.

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:08.747
Here, take it.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.261
How beautiful that was.

00:45:28.434 --> 00:45:29.935
I do mean that.

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.360
Let's finish off the game.

00:45:40.863 --> 00:45:42.531
Let's both do it for her.

00:46:15.731 --> 00:46:16.774
Yes!

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:32.998
Okay.

00:46:39.546 --> 00:46:41.006
Yes!

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:19.545
Gah!

00:47:24.299 --> 00:47:26.134
Yes!

00:47:27.219 --> 00:47:29.137
Hmm! I win!

00:47:47.948 --> 00:47:49.116
Well done.

00:47:50.742 --> 00:47:52.661
You finished three sets.

00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:56.874
You didn't quit or forfeit the match.

00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:03.630
Congratulations, Arisu.

00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:08.635
The game has ended.

00:48:13.098 --> 00:48:14.141
Finally…

00:48:17.477 --> 00:48:18.729
Is it over?

00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:27.446
Yeah.

00:48:29.656 --> 00:48:31.074
We won, Usagi.

00:48:48.717 --> 00:48:49.593
Well?

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:53.764
What is this place? Can you tell me now?

00:48:59.019 --> 00:49:00.020
Arisu.

00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:04.650
You'll find out soon enough.

00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:12.658
You will be given two choices.

00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:16.536
No matter which one you pick,

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.581
you will learn the answer.

00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:24.920
And you'll learn who you really are
when you choose.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.382
You'll soon find out.

00:49:31.718 --> 00:49:33.095
Life is just…

00:49:34.763 --> 00:49:36.473
a game we play together.

00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:41.687
You should try to enjoy it.

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:14.177
Congratulations.

00:50:14.803 --> 00:50:18.515
All of the games have now been cleared.

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:34.341
All surviving players
will be presented with two choices.

00:51:35.884 --> 00:51:38.136
Players must now all decide

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.890
whether to accept
permanent residency in this country,

00:51:41.973 --> 00:51:43.892
or decline it.

00:51:45.143 --> 00:51:46.353
Once again,

00:51:47.312 --> 00:51:52.025
players must now decide
whether to accept permanent residency,

00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:53.777
or decline it.

00:51:59.866 --> 00:52:01.076
I decline.

00:52:33.608 --> 00:52:34.651
And I…

00:52:36.194 --> 00:52:37.904
don't want it!

00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:05.849
I decline.

00:53:29.497 --> 00:53:31.291
Let's go back together.

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:46.514
I accept, naturally.

00:53:47.807 --> 00:53:49.559
I will gladly take it as well.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.652
I want

00:54:00.237 --> 00:54:01.613
to turn it down,

00:54:02.197 --> 00:54:03.323
I think.

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:08.620
What are you gonna say?

00:54:18.129 --> 00:54:19.839
I decline.

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:53.123
I decline.

00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:58.211
I'm choosing not to stay here.

00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:03.717
Same for me.

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:09.097
I don't want it.

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:29.200
You want the usual?

00:55:31.953 --> 00:55:32.871
Sure, thanks.

00:55:34.456 --> 00:55:35.457
Here you go.

00:55:38.918 --> 00:55:39.753
Hey.

00:55:42.422 --> 00:55:43.256
What?

00:55:46.926 --> 00:55:48.511
One big-ass nose hair…

00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:49.971
Wait, what?

00:55:50.055 --> 00:55:50.930
Really?

00:55:51.639 --> 00:55:54.142
- No.
- Aw, you're such a piece of shit!

00:55:59.898 --> 00:56:01.816
Ah, you just looked so depressed.

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:06.821
Listen, did you know you can
pull out your nose hair with wax?

00:56:06.905 --> 00:56:09.491
- That would hurt so bad!
- And they never grow back?

00:56:09.574 --> 00:56:11.076
Nah, they still grow back!

00:56:11.159 --> 00:56:13.244
- Then using a trimmer is way better.
- Oh, sure.

00:56:13.328 --> 00:56:15.997
What if something
falls on top of you while you're doing it?

00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:19.667
- That would hurt even worse.
- Well, not as badly as an explosion.

00:56:19.751 --> 00:56:22.087
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.343
I'm sorry.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.304
I'm sorry.

00:56:33.348 --> 00:56:34.641
It's my fault.

00:56:36.434 --> 00:56:37.268
I'm sorry.

00:56:38.603 --> 00:56:40.355
Oh, his fault, he says.

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:43.108
Someone thinks highly of himself.

00:56:43.191 --> 00:56:47.404
I bet you think you're alive because
you're, like, a chosen one or something.

00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:50.365
I don't! It's thanks to you guys.

00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:55.286
Come on. That makes it sound like we all
sacrificed ourselves to keep you alive.

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:58.456
Chota, hey. Wasn't that a little harsh?

00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.792
Arisu's missing
the whole point, seriously.

00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:03.920
What the hell?

00:57:04.963 --> 00:57:06.464
What are you trying to say?

00:57:07.966 --> 00:57:09.509
Just tell me, come on.

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:14.305
Listen, man, it's like this.

00:57:16.516 --> 00:57:19.602
Across all these games,
there hasn't been a single one,

00:57:19.686 --> 00:57:21.688
not one, that you cleared on your own.

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:24.607
You could go on thanking us
for the rest of your life

00:57:24.691 --> 00:57:26.401
and it still wouldn't be enough.

00:57:27.318 --> 00:57:28.278
Okay…

00:57:29.571 --> 00:57:32.031
Should I apologize
for the rest of my life, then?

00:57:34.409 --> 00:57:35.326
Don't be an idiot.

00:57:36.202 --> 00:57:38.079
We want you to live your life, man.

00:57:38.913 --> 00:57:40.748
Live it to the fuckin' fullest.

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:47.297
All right.

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.091
Promise.

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:37.764
I'd be down with zombies
showing up in Shibuya.

00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:40.308
Everyone here gets bitten,
and they all turn into zombies.

00:58:40.391 --> 00:58:42.644
Stop it with the zombie talk,
will ya?

00:58:42.727 --> 00:58:46.022
If zombies did show up here,
only Karube would survive.

00:58:46.105 --> 00:58:48.566
You'd knock 'em out with one punch.

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:51.611
I doubt that.
You'd be the one to survive, Arisu.

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:53.488
Me? Why's that?

00:58:54.656 --> 00:58:55.990
'Cause I know you'd outsmart 'em.

00:58:59.661 --> 00:59:01.329
Shit. Let's do this.

00:59:01.412 --> 00:59:02.413
- Come on!
- Whoa--

00:59:02.497 --> 00:59:04.457
- Whoa!
- Whoa, what are you doing?

00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:07.001
You know, this is the first day
of your independence!

00:59:07.085 --> 00:59:09.170
- Coming through! Step aside!
- Whoa! Whoa!

00:59:09.254 --> 00:59:11.256
Gangway!

00:59:11.339 --> 00:59:13.341
Hey, slow down!

00:59:47.166 --> 00:59:49.210
Whoa! Whoa!

00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:50.962
Get down!

00:59:51.045 --> 00:59:52.630
- Quick!
- You guys are crazy!

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:56.801
Okay, run! Run!

00:59:56.884 --> 00:59:58.803
- We can make it!
- Look, fireworks!

00:59:58.886 --> 00:59:59.929
- Run for your lives!
- Go!

01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:02.432
Fuck, man!

01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:04.392
Come on!

01:00:04.475 --> 01:00:06.436
Fuck, fuck! It's the police!
This is bad!

01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:08.438
- So bad! I'm sorry!
- Oh no… Run!

01:00:11.065 --> 01:00:12.984
The stairs!

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:55.628
Can you hear me? Sir!

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.505
- Can you hear me?
- I need a check here!

01:01:57.588 --> 01:01:59.048
- His vitals?
- Now!

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:00.258
Copy that.

01:02:01.175 --> 01:02:02.260
We've got a pulse!

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.804
He's breathing!

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:07.473
He's alive! We need a stretcher!

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.517
- Resume CPR.
- Okay.

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:11.310
We need a gurney here!

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:13.563
Now! Hurry!

01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:50.850
It has been two days since
a meteorite exploded over Tokyo…

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:54.937
Structural damage is
centered around a 10 km radius

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:56.731
from Shibuya Park Street…

01:02:58.149 --> 01:03:02.904
…has extended its condolences
to the following families.

01:03:02.987 --> 01:03:05.865
Some names are Kairi Nakamura,

01:03:06.532 --> 01:03:08.159
Daikichi Karube…

01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:09.702
The government's set up…

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.579
…Kihiro Sato,

01:03:11.662 --> 01:03:13.790
Chota Segawa,

01:03:14.373 --> 01:03:16.209
Kodai Tatta,

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:18.753
Saori Shibuki…

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:22.173
Karube and Chota are dead now.

01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:25.718
And I get to live?

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.013
Don't beat yourself up.

01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:31.933
It'll only make it worse.

01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:36.896
Survivor's guilt.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.649
It's a hell of a thing to deal with.

01:03:41.692 --> 01:03:43.903
"Why me? Why am I alive?"

01:03:45.112 --> 01:03:47.824
"Why couldn't they have been saved too?"
You know?

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.870
Apparently, it happens
to most people after disasters.

01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:55.498
They end up blaming themselves.

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:01.629
But when they finally
found your body,

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.799
your heart had completely stopped.

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:10.763
A whole minute went by.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:18.479
Apparently, for a minute,
the borderlands had taken you.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:22.358
A minute?

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:24.193
Yeah.

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:32.869
A minute?

01:04:37.623 --> 01:04:38.666
You know…

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.211
it felt like…

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:45.631
a lot longer.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.636
Like I'd gone away for a long time.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.728
You know, uh…

01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:01.188
Dad cried.

01:05:03.357 --> 01:05:04.817
The last time he cried

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:07.862
must've been when Mom died.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:44.815
What do you want?

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:50.738
It looks to me like you must have
experienced a cardiac arrest.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.784
What are you, a doctor?

01:05:57.912 --> 01:05:59.288
Well, I did too.

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:03.668
What a coincidence.

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:08.756
So we both almost died.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:11.884
You feel any different now?

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:15.554
I don't know.

01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:19.225
I mean, I look a lot worse.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:21.894
What about you?

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:28.859
I've been thinking a lot about my life.

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:31.988
Choices I had to make.

01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:35.116
Pretty sure I'm gonna
be turning my life around.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.829
Or something like that.

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:45.084
You were a piece of shit, too, huh?

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.502
You fucked up?

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.879
I did.

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:09.942
Huh. After his cardiac arrest,
it's a miracle he's come this far already.

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:12.570
- Could you get me some gauze, please?
- Yes, doctor.

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:21.746
Is it someone you know?

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:23.289
No. Not really.

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:29.962
But I do understand.

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:33.090
I bet he's trying to survive too.

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:35.426
He is.

01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:57.740
Commencing cardiac massage.

01:07:57.823 --> 01:07:59.116
Get the defib ready, now!

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.119
- Right away, doctor!
- Miss Ann, can you hear me?

01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:04.038
- Miss Ann!
- Clear!

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:06.290
Still no pulse!

01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:10.127
- Again! Charge it!
- Yes, sir! Charge complete!

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:11.670
Clear!

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.257
We have a pulse!

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:18.385
Normal sinus rhythm.
Heart rate is holding between 80 and 90.

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:19.678
She's back!

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:21.055
Resume operation!

01:08:21.138 --> 01:08:22.848
- Forceps.
- Here, doctor.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:36.028
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.280
There's no need to rush at all.

01:08:38.364 --> 01:08:39.907
- You're doing very well.
- Okay.

01:09:28.164 --> 01:09:29.665
You came back to us.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.354
Hikari.

01:10:15.127 --> 01:10:18.797
…has released two trillion yen
from the national treasury

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.216
for emergency relief.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:25.054
A week has passed
since the meteorite exploded over Tokyo.

01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:30.643
Even now, all metro and railway operations
have been suspended in Tokyo,

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:34.313
and many major roads
have been shut down as well.

01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:13.102
Sorry…

01:11:13.852 --> 01:11:15.604
Do you mind if I use it?

01:11:16.188 --> 01:11:18.232
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:46.844
Hey, wait.

01:11:48.053 --> 01:11:49.054
Your change.

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:52.558
Oh!

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:54.685
Thanks a lot.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:08.490
Um…

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:11.285
Sorry, but have we met before?

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:14.913
I don't think so.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.502
Wait.

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:27.301
Are you sure that I don't know you, miss?

01:12:28.552 --> 01:12:29.470
Uh…

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:36.018
Are you, uh,

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:38.520
flirting with me?

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:40.773
Uh, no.

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:42.149
It's not like that.

01:12:44.568 --> 01:12:46.820
Uh, wait. Wait. Stop!

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:48.364
Um, miss.

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:51.283
Would it be all right if I was?

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.534
Flirting with you?

01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:02.836
I'm sorry.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:05.172
That wasn't cool of me.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:13.430
I think maybe we have met before.

01:13:15.974 --> 01:13:17.893
Uh, was it last year?

01:13:18.685 --> 01:13:20.145
Or was it…

01:13:21.188 --> 01:13:22.439
When was that?

01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:25.818
I don't know.

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:28.195
But we've met.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.916
Uh, the sun's out. It's pretty nice.

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:46.213
Do you want to maybe step out?
Go for a walk?

01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:49.049
Mm. Mm-hmm!
