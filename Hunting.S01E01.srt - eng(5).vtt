Your takeout has arrived.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.050
Where would you like me to leave it?

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.450
Just leave it at the door.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.990
Okay.

Long's deliveries are all overdue.

I don't know what's going on.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:08.830
He was delivering for me.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.110
I'll go look for him.

Captain Luo,

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.640
the crime scene is inside.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.650
Be careful.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:07.760
Watch your step, everyone.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.040
It must be "Pink Meth".

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.030
We'll need the lab report
for the exact composition.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:26.210
By the way,

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:28.470
have you found any witnesses?

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.680
We've sent people
to check nearby surveillance cameras.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.730
DNA samples have also been collected
from the scene,

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.930
but we need to wait for the test results.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.210
Who reported the case?

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.120
Also a local delivery guy.

Do you know you're two hours late?

That's disgusting.

We're all from the Mou family.

Do I look like my uncle?

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:03.690
Not at all.

Take another good look.

If we worked for a drug lord,

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.850
we wouldn't have to work
so hard for money.
