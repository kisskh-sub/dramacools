00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.799
Any Vaccine cards?

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.384
No.

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:11.886
What are we gonna do?

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.105
What's wrong?

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.107
You look pale.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.193
I'm fine.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.945
Be honest.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:33.450
Are you a zombie?

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:39.205
Yes, I am.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.582
He was hiding it!

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:42.417
No! I was going to tell you.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.919
And I remember the guy who turned me.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.673
Let's shoot that zombie.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:51.843
You're up next.

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:56.264
-Go kill that zombie.
-What?

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:59.934
Have someone else do it.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.562
He's basically just a kid.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.398
No, you don't have to go.

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:09.903
That's not fair to those
who dutifully used their Shotgun cards.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.867
You think anyone here
wants to kill people?

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.496
We shouldn't kill each other.

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:25.710
Then what about you?

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.297
You've never killed someone in a game?

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:41.059
We won't survive
without sacrificing others.

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:46.689
Go.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.026
Don't.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.111
Arisu!

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.612
-Asshole!
-Hold him down!

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:56.825
If you don't do it,

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:00.286
we'll shoot him.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:05.708
Don't go.

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:08.128
Please, Ikeno.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.547
There's got to be another way.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.598
Open.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.158
I'm sorry.

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:08.331
I'm sorry.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.014
Four rounds left.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.434
Please choose an opponent
by touching them.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.662
Took long enough!

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:52.709
I know.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.711
Did you do it?

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:01.843
Yes.

00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:12.312
Well done.

00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:16.441
Round of applause. Go on!

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.071
Well done.

00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:45.636
Where's Nobu?

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.306
He said he'd be right back.

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:12.080
Nobu?

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.088
-Hey!
-Look.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.090
Let me go!

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:31.099
He turned that brat into a zombie.

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.517
"That brat"?

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.145
You mean Nobu?

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.105
That's right.

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:38.481
Nobu…

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:41.692
Where'd he go?

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:45.029
I saw him walking alone.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.657
That bastard.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:50.618
Bring him here!

00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:52.286
-Okay!
-Got it!

00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:56.290
People are starting to hide the fact
that they've turned.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.836
Like that bastard, Masato,
and that brat, Nobu.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.588
There could be more zombies among us.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.259
You're right.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.220
I don't trust some of you.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.567
No.

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:24.986
Not me.

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:27.196
He's a drug user

00:07:27.905 --> 00:07:29.740
suffering from withdrawal.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:33.661
The person who started this group,
Rei, is a zombie.

00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:38.541
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen her around.

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:43.754
She might be a spy for the zombies.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.299
What?

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:49.886
Does she really have a Vaccine card?

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.096
What if it was all a lie?

00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:58.186
What if she came here
to make more zombies?

00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:09.739
The game's almost over.

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:15.745
Let's get rid of our zombies too.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.998
We'll just shoot them all.

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:46.317
No, don't.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.324
That hurts!

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:57.495
Hey!

00:08:57.578 --> 00:08:58.788
Stop!

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:00.206
He's making a run for it!

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:18.516
Hey!

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:23.187
I've been looking for you. I need a favor.

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:24.772
What is it?

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.817
Would you use your Vaccine card on me?

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.443
There he is!

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.032
Don't run!

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.617
Stop it!

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.246
-Stand up!
-Three rounds left.

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:44.208
Please choose an opponent
by touching them.

00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:48.212
These guys…

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.631
Shoot 'em all!

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:52.508
Stand up.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.564
Please place your cards.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.635
Nobu.

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:39.013
You're a zombie.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.182
What?

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:43.559
I can tell.

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:46.729
Listen.

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:49.106
Do exactly as I say.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:11:00.368
Unfortunately, the zombies have spread
even more than you guys think.

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:04.538
You might be better off as a zombie too.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.793
How would you know that?

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:16.050
People have feelings,
which makes it difficult to kill others.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:21.263
And they'll hesitate to use
their precious Vaccine card on others.

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:27.561
Zombies rapidly multiply
while they hold on to their cards.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.564
Once you've been turned,

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:34.110
there's no reason
to not use your Zombie card.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:39.990
There were four zombies
when the game started.

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:45.162
If the infection proceeded exponentially,
as one might expect,

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:49.166
zombies would become
the majority in a mere

00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:51.544
three rounds.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.383
Don't you see which side
has the advantage?

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.679
Did you really think

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:04.348
I'd buy that?

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:07.226
That's totally up to you.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:13.315
Either I get shot and die now
and you die at the end of the game,

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:19.780
or you accept my deal now,
become a zombie, and survive.

00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:43.971
Open.

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.996
I'm afraid I'm gonna pass on that deal.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.062
Masato.

00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:36.690
-We're too late.
-It's no use.

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:38.192
Rei's in danger.

00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:40.444
-It's over!
-Nobu.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:41.821
-I'm dead!
-Nobu!

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:44.949
Do what I said.

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.383
Now we'll win.

00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:04.927
This is…

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.721
It's going too far!

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:12.184
The zombies want to kill us
because we killed their teammates.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:18.023
But zombies can't kill humans
in this game.

00:14:19.316 --> 00:14:22.820
Go ahead and become a zombie
if you wanna die too.

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:29.618
Those guys are bad news.
They're going insane.

00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:34.540
Nobu!

00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:36.667
Over here. Hurry!

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:41.589
What happened?

00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:43.465
Please listen.

00:14:55.769 --> 00:14:56.770
What's wrong?

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:05.946
I was tricked.

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:33.265
Rei.

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.067
You're alive.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.614
Two rounds left.

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:52.076
-Please choose an opponent by…
-Find them!

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:56.830
Why play me?

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.043
Which side do you think will win?

00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:07.967
The zombies.

00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:12.054
That was your conclusion all along.

00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:13.472
Well, yeah.

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:17.726
Either the zombies win
through exponential growth,

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.438
or humans freak out
and win by killing tons of zombies.

00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:24.316
It was going to be one or the other.

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:27.319
Rei.

00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:28.821
What?

00:16:29.446 --> 00:16:30.739
You're not really

00:16:32.032 --> 00:16:33.117
a zombie, are you?

00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:37.121
Please place your cards.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.086
If you were a zombie,

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.464
why build this barricade of trust?

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.718
What was your endgame?

00:16:51.635 --> 00:16:56.849
You'd end up dead
if no one saved you with the vaccine.

00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:01.478
You thought gratitude would save you?

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:07.276
A strategist like you
wouldn't risk her life

00:17:07.776 --> 00:17:10.112
on a plan that depends on gratitude.

00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:13.198
I see.

00:17:14.074 --> 00:17:18.579
But if you aren't really a zombie,

00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:21.498
then your plan is perfect.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.585
Is that really possible?

00:17:26.253 --> 00:17:29.006
Even if you didn't have a Zombie card,

00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:34.219
as long as everyone believed
your reasoning and it built trust,

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.638
then, yes, it's possible.

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:42.519
The barricade of trust was built on a lie.

00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:47.441
But trust is born when people believe you.

00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:53.155
I see what you mean.

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:57.242
And that's also why you survived
your game against Ikeno.

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.663
Ikeno used his Shotgun card, didn't he?

00:18:02.372 --> 00:18:04.124
But you didn't die.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.835
That's because you're not a zombie.

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:10.339
Open.

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:21.183
So?

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:25.270
Why did you come to play me?

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.398
To save you, Rei.

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.159
You're a zombie?

00:18:45.332 --> 00:18:50.129
And here I thought
people like you don't lie.

00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:57.761
Now you're a zombie too.

00:18:58.762 --> 00:19:01.431
If you believed the zombies would win,

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:04.351
why didn't you become one?

00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:08.981
I thought the zombies would win,
but I wasn't sure.

00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:13.902
When I built the barricade,
I thought the humans might win.

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.737
That's why I built it.

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:22.995
But I couldn't be sure,
so I waited to see how things played out.

00:19:23.912 --> 00:19:27.166
After watching Ikeno and his lackeys,

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.836
I kinda started thinking

00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:33.964
human cruelty might win.

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.011
But, Arisu,

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.097
playing you convinced me.

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.183
Thank you.

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:48.604
The final round will now begin.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.856
We better hurry.

00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:54.484
How long were you a zombie?

00:19:56.361 --> 00:19:57.321
From the start.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.951
Sick move.

00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:06.371
Natsu!

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.334
-Shion!
-Arisu!

00:20:15.088 --> 00:20:16.840
I got turned, like Nobu said.

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.009
We can all turn in one more round.

00:20:20.844 --> 00:20:21.887
Where'd Nobu go?

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:23.805
To find Tetsu.

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:35.943
Shit.

00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:37.444
Tetsu!

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:39.738
Tetsu?

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:46.954
Please.

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:48.997
Hear me out, please.

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:52.793
Let me go!

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.298
-Anyone there?
-Nope.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.636
Hey! Over here!

00:21:02.719 --> 00:21:04.263
Hey, let's go!

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:05.722
After 'em!

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:20.404
Stop!

00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:28.912
-Time's almost up! Find Tetsu!
-Got it!

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.585
Tetsu!

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.511
He's over here!

00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:47.264
This way!

00:21:47.347 --> 00:21:48.974
Found him over here!

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.650
Please choose an opponent
by touching them.

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:00.152
Nobu, the round's starting!

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.072
Your Shotgun card's gone. Let's play!

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.244
Open.

00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:18.003
Tetsu.

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:19.713
Tetsu!

00:22:20.213 --> 00:22:21.506
I'll explain later.

00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:31.099
Shit!

00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:34.311
Kazuya.

00:22:36.229 --> 00:22:37.564
I just saved you.

00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:40.776
What?

00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:45.030
The final round is over.

00:22:48.158 --> 00:22:51.370
Here are the totals.

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:53.497
Zombies,

00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:55.540
32.

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:57.709
Humans,

00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:00.670
13.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.715
Zombies win.

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.052
Yes!

00:23:07.677 --> 00:23:08.887
We did it!

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:11.890
Thank goodness!

00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:24.945
There were fewer humans,
so it's game over for those 13 players.

00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:33.662
Seriously?

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.587
All right!

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:47.259
We won.

00:24:32.929 --> 00:24:34.055
Come with us.

00:25:05.921 --> 00:25:08.173
PLEASE PROCEED 16 KM SOUTHWEST

00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:11.426
THE "GAME" WILL BE HELD
AT SUNDOWN IN TWO DAYS

00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:28.693
Don't hold it against me.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.035
I wasn't going to.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:39.996
It's just a game.

00:25:41.831 --> 00:25:42.832
That it is.

00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:49.839
Let's get some sleep.

00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:03.520
Okay, your bedhead
won't be so bad tomorrow.

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:06.398
Thanks, Big Sister.

00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:07.941
I'm not your sister.

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:17.075
Huh?

00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:19.995
Isn't Arisu gonna sleep?

00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:25.208
I bet he's thinking about his wife.

00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:30.380
I'm jealous.

00:26:31.464 --> 00:26:37.053
My husband is
quick to yell at me and hit me.

00:26:38.471 --> 00:26:40.724
I've wished him dead so many times.

00:26:43.643 --> 00:26:46.646
It must be nice
to love someone with all your heart.

00:26:53.903 --> 00:26:54.738
Hey!

00:26:54.821 --> 00:26:56.239
-Stop it!
-Damn you!

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.348
-Arisu…
-Wanna come over?

00:28:06.142 --> 00:28:07.268
What's wrong?

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.521
Where are you?

00:28:14.734 --> 00:28:15.735
Arisu…

00:28:17.654 --> 00:28:18.613
Yeah?

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:21.116
I'll come get you.

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:38.675
Usagi?

00:28:39.968 --> 00:28:40.969
I'm sorry.

00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:42.053
Usa--

00:28:43.012 --> 00:28:45.306
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.935
When I dream,

00:28:50.478 --> 00:28:54.357
I can feel my dad's presence.

00:28:57.527 --> 00:28:59.070
I want to see him again.

00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:02.365
If I can see my dad,

00:29:04.492 --> 00:29:06.453
I don't care if it's a nightmare.

00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:13.960
Please, Dad.

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.129
Dad, please! Don't go!

00:29:17.046 --> 00:29:18.047
Don't go!

00:29:26.222 --> 00:29:28.683
I want to ask you about your father.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.146
Would you help me?

00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:37.484
If my dad is there…

00:29:39.819 --> 00:29:41.613
Even if it's a nightmare…

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:45.742
I want to be there.

00:30:29.118 --> 00:30:30.578
For real?!

00:31:15.415 --> 00:31:16.291
Look out!

00:31:18.459 --> 00:31:19.586
People aren't shields!

00:31:20.503 --> 00:31:22.422
Just worry about yourself.

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:35.810
Move!

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:05.256
This way!

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:16.017
Ryuji, follow my lead.

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:46.047
Can't believe you survived like that.

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:49.884
I managed somehow. And I had some help.

00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:52.679
Usagi, are you an athlete or what?

00:32:53.554 --> 00:32:54.555
Nope.

00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:57.600
I climb mountains for fun.

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:01.813
I feel like I've met you before.

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:07.735
So Usagi is your last name,
not a nickname?

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:09.278
"Usagi."

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:10.613
Yeah.

00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:14.450
Was your dad a mountain climber?

00:33:15.868 --> 00:33:18.913
I must've recognized you
from the gossip magazines.

00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:21.958
That mountain climber in the headlines?

00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:24.210
He killed himself
after lying about a climb.

00:33:24.293 --> 00:33:25.128
Yeah, him.

00:33:27.213 --> 00:33:28.047
Oh.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.841
Sorry.

00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:34.262
It's the magazines' fault.
Don't let it bother you.

00:33:35.763 --> 00:33:37.473
-Hey.
-Well, it's true.

00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:39.851
Did he really kill himself?

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:42.270
-Ask her.
-I can't do that.

00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:43.187
Just ask.

00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:45.857
Do you care what people like that say?

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.319
My dad wasn't one to lie.

00:33:52.822 --> 00:33:54.240
He'd never kill himself.

00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:01.914
You say that,
but you have your doubts, don't you?

00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:05.251
If it weren't for you,

00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:08.963
I'd never have come back here.

00:34:09.756 --> 00:34:10.757
I wonder.

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:14.719
When I first saw you,
I sensed we were alike.

00:34:16.137 --> 00:34:19.057
We can't escape
the death haunting our lives.

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:24.687
You wanted to be with your dead father.

00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:28.900
Isn't that what you always felt,
deep in your heart?

00:34:29.984 --> 00:34:33.196
That's why you accepted my offer.

00:34:34.655 --> 00:34:37.325
I never wanted to come back here.

00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:42.080
Never wanted to make Arisu sad.

00:34:42.163 --> 00:34:44.290
Deep inside, you felt differently.

00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:46.334
No, I'm not like you.

00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:52.131
I've always wanted to come here.

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:58.888
I want to see the world of death
that lies beyond this borderland.

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:18.366
I knew you'd be the one to survive.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.536
You…

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:24.872
Who are you?

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:27.834
You know who I am?

00:35:29.293 --> 00:35:30.128
Yes.

00:35:30.878 --> 00:35:34.257
I've devoted myself
to finding people like you.

00:35:35.383 --> 00:35:38.302
People qualified to become able citizens.

00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:41.013
Citizens?

00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:45.852
You've already been there, right?

00:35:46.727 --> 00:35:51.858
You made it to the end,
surviving many games despite your legs.

00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:55.319
You should remember by now.

00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:03.327
I have a favor to ask.

00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:07.665
Bring a certain woman
you know to that land.

00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:12.253
In exchange, I'll show you
the world you seek.

00:36:13.963 --> 00:36:16.674
You want to see the afterlife, right?

00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:20.553
Beyond the land between life and death

00:36:20.636 --> 00:36:22.555
lies the real world of death.

00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:26.350
What'll it be?

00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:28.769
Do you accept my deal?

00:36:30.771 --> 00:36:34.567
Will I really get what I want?

00:36:35.651 --> 00:36:37.653
-Yes.
-But how do I do it?

00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:43.284
She still carries the shadow
of her dead father deep in her heart.

00:36:45.494 --> 00:36:48.289
She will come if you invite her.

00:36:48.998 --> 00:36:50.416
"Invite her"?

00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:52.293
How?

00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:58.382
Have her drink this.

00:37:00.509 --> 00:37:03.137
Then you'll get what you want.

00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:07.683
So, what will it be?

00:37:20.446 --> 00:37:21.447
All right.

00:37:24.784 --> 00:37:25.785
I'll do it.

00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:47.932
That guy, Ryuji,
actually brought her here.

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:53.729
And Arisu came, too, just as you planned.

00:37:56.399 --> 00:37:58.359
Arisu won't ever part with Usagi.

00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:03.197
Human emotions are invisible threads.

00:38:03.906 --> 00:38:06.409
Tug on them, and they always respond.

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:09.829
What will you do next?

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:13.666
I'll make good use of Ryuji.

00:38:13.749 --> 00:38:15.084
He's a valuable asset.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.547
He's quite eccentric too.

00:38:20.548 --> 00:38:22.508
He wants to see the afterlife.

00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:27.680
Above all, emotional threads
are growing between him and Usagi.

00:38:28.764 --> 00:38:31.559
I'll control him by tugging those threads.

00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:36.105
The game is finally getting interesting.

00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:43.070
You're scary.

00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:10.139
The required number of teams
has been reached.

00:39:12.141 --> 00:39:13.893
The game will now commence.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.940
THE TRAIN IS ARRIVING

00:40:17.873 --> 00:40:21.669
NOT IN SERVICE

00:40:27.466 --> 00:40:29.760
The game is Runaway Train.

00:40:43.649 --> 00:40:48.612
Here are the rules.
This train operates autonomously.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:53.242
Try to make it to the front car
from the starting car.

00:40:53.325 --> 00:40:55.202
Once the stop siren sounds,

00:40:57.079 --> 00:41:00.249
you must stop the train
in order to win the game.

00:41:02.418 --> 00:41:06.422
Thirty seconds after you move
to the car ahead and the door locks,

00:41:06.505 --> 00:41:10.926
either oxygen or poison gas
will be released.

00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:12.720
"Poison gas"?

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.514
Excluding this starting car,

00:41:15.598 --> 00:41:19.768
poison gas will be released
in four of the eight cars.

00:41:21.103 --> 00:41:26.150
Please decide whether
to put on a gas mask before then.

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:30.488
Each player gets five gas cartridges.

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:35.576
Please attach them to the intake
on the right side of your mask.

00:41:36.869 --> 00:41:41.624
The cartridges contain
a neutralizing agent for the poison gas.

00:41:42.958 --> 00:41:47.129
You cannot use
another player's cartridges.

00:41:48.756 --> 00:41:52.092
And you cannot return to the car you left.

00:41:54.553 --> 00:41:57.723
Now strap your cartridges to your arm

00:41:57.806 --> 00:42:00.059
and take your gas mask.

00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:15.241
Game start.

00:42:15.824 --> 00:42:18.327
Please move to the next car.

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.482
What's with the bird?

00:42:50.943 --> 00:42:53.779
If the canary dies from the gas,

00:42:55.155 --> 00:42:56.532
we'll know it's poison.

00:42:57.866 --> 00:42:58.867
I see.

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:03.872
Please make your choice.

00:43:42.745 --> 00:43:43.579
What now?

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:49.460
Sohta.

00:44:04.016 --> 00:44:05.517
This isn't a gas car.

00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:07.895
Oh no.

00:44:08.395 --> 00:44:10.105
We just wasted a cartridge?

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:13.025
No, it's fine.

00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:17.488
There are four gas cars.
We still have four cartridges.

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:33.128
Please move to the next car.

00:44:45.641 --> 00:44:47.976
Please make your choice.

00:45:32.646 --> 00:45:33.772
It was poison gas!

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:36.275
We're safe!

00:45:45.033 --> 00:45:48.454
CAR 3

00:45:48.537 --> 00:45:51.248
Please make your choice.

00:45:53.459 --> 00:45:54.543
What should we do?

00:45:58.255 --> 00:45:59.381
I'm not using it.

00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:00.841
Why not?

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.928
Everyone is scared,
so they mask up in the first half.

00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:10.768
The game creator will count on that
and release poison gas in the second half.

00:46:14.521 --> 00:46:17.691
-I'll try without it.
-That's just rolling the dice.

00:46:18.567 --> 00:46:20.194
There might be another way.

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:24.156
We're in the third car. Five more to go.

00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:27.743
Three have poison gas,
and we have three cartridges left.

00:46:30.996 --> 00:46:32.498
What should we do?

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:37.419
We won't wear them.

00:46:39.379 --> 00:46:41.298
What if your brother's wrong?

00:46:41.381 --> 00:46:43.801
-What's your problem?
-Chill out.

00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:26.969
Nothing you can do if it's poison.

00:47:39.898 --> 00:47:40.941
It's not poison.

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:42.401
Thank goodness!

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:49.825
What a relief.

00:47:49.908 --> 00:47:51.201
We're safe.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.396
It's bound for Asakusa!

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:23.775
It runs parallel
to Omotesando and Aoyama-Itchome!

00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:24.735
A train nerd?

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:07.903
We won't make it
if we wear our masks next time

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:10.322
and it's not a gas car.

00:49:13.033 --> 00:49:15.953
You seem to know a lot about trains.

00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:18.789
Yeah.

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:23.585
It looked like the people we just saw
took a while to die.

00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:26.171
So I bet it's a nerve gas
heavier than air.

00:49:26.672 --> 00:49:29.257
You'd need a lot to fill a car.

00:49:29.883 --> 00:49:32.886
-And?
-There have to be tanks for the gas.

00:49:33.387 --> 00:49:36.390
The poison gas cars
likely need space for them.

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:37.474
Any ideas?

00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:40.143
There's no way I'd know that.

00:49:40.227 --> 00:49:43.063
We're running out of time.
We gotta decide!

00:49:44.898 --> 00:49:46.274
The train that went by…

00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:48.944
Maybe it was a trick.

00:49:49.027 --> 00:49:51.655
They could be trying to scare us.

00:49:51.738 --> 00:49:52.739
It's possible.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.576
We won't have enough cartridges
if we use our masks now.

00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.454
Wait.

00:50:03.583 --> 00:50:07.713
I'm not completely sure,
but this type of car

00:50:08.588 --> 00:50:10.716
shouldn't have a pantograph.

00:50:11.299 --> 00:50:12.592
A pantograph?

00:50:13.427 --> 00:50:14.553
On the roof?

00:50:14.636 --> 00:50:15.595
Yes.

00:50:16.096 --> 00:50:18.390
It allows the train to draw power.

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:23.437
If there's a pantograph,
it will occupy a lot of roof space.

00:50:24.104 --> 00:50:28.066
But this car shouldn't have one.

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:33.655
So you're saying
there's space for a gas tank?

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:38.785
Yes, most likely.

00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:41.538
"Most likely"?

00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:43.832
I'm gonna trust that?

00:50:46.168 --> 00:50:48.462
Please make your choice.

00:50:53.425 --> 00:50:54.342
What do we do?

00:50:54.426 --> 00:50:55.427
What now?

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:19.594
-I'm sorry!
-Yuna!

00:53:04.556 --> 00:53:06.850
CAR 5

00:53:14.274 --> 00:53:16.359
Four cars left, including this one.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:22.073
There are still two poison gas cars,
and we only have two cartridges left.

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:24.034
How about this car?

00:53:26.411 --> 00:53:27.579
This car

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.624
should have a pantograph.

00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:34.502
So there's no space for a gas tank.

00:54:22.884 --> 00:54:25.971
CAR 6

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:29.099
Wait.

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:33.645
These racks are wrong.

00:54:35.397 --> 00:54:37.274
-I see.
-What is it?

00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:42.904
I'm sorry. I got the model wrong.

00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:47.158
-What?
-It's a different train model.

00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:51.121
So the pantograph locations differ too.

00:54:52.872 --> 00:54:55.709
I'm sorry! I don't know what to do now.

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.171
So we just got lucky?

00:55:01.881 --> 00:55:02.841
That's right.

00:55:02.924 --> 00:55:04.217
You asshole!

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:06.303
Aren't you a train nerd?!

00:55:06.386 --> 00:55:08.179
-Well?!
-Stop it!

00:55:09.431 --> 00:55:10.473
There's no time.

00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:14.894
Please make your choice.

00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:17.605
Two cartridges left.

00:55:17.689 --> 00:55:18.565
CAR 6

00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:20.275
And two more gas cars.

00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:22.861
We can't make a single mistake.

00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:38.251
So it's up to a hunch?

00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:41.338
Yep.

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.681
I'll bet… on her hunch.

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:57.604
Me too.

00:55:59.064 --> 00:56:00.315
My bet is on Usagi.

00:56:01.399 --> 00:56:02.734
This might just work.

00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:09.699
Sounds good to me.

00:56:13.995 --> 00:56:15.622
A test of luck at the end.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:37.143
Come on, poison gas.

00:56:59.707 --> 00:57:00.708
It's alive.

00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:03.086
This isn't a gas car!

00:59:36.864 --> 00:59:39.534
