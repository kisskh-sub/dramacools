00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:32.657
"You must be the change
you wish to see in the world."

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:35.285
That's what Gandhi said.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:38.705
I…

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.834
will create a utopian society.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:48.214
For all of those
who have fallen into despair,

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.386
if we do not have hope,

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.555
then we must create it!

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.227
This will be the land of hope.

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:03.772
SEASIDE PARADISE
TOKYO

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:07.817
I will make this oasis
into the second Beach!

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.492
{\an8}BEACH

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:17.989
How long are you gonna sleep?

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:23.036
Are you hungover?

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.130
Did you get any information?

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.758
I'm afraid not.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.056
I think I'd better get up
and get some info.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.645
Seems like Hatter
has taken a liking to you.

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:53.107
You'd better be careful.
The militant corps will be watching you.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.319
And we have no idea
what they're capable of.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:06.371
I was talking to these guys
who drove all the way to the suburbs.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:09.332
They were saying that
the further you get from the city,

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.334
the crappier and more run-down
the streets are,

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:14.003
and if you keep goin',
it looks like you're actually in a jungle.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.423
They decided they weren't taking
any chances and didn't go any further.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:18.341
Seriously?

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:22.553
I heard that all the game arenas
are pretty much inside Tokyo!

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.181
Come on, people! Who wants to party?

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:30.603
There are rumors about people
who tried escaping the country by boat,

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.356
but then those lasers came down
from the sky and killed all of them.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.899
You hear about that?

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.109
Hang on a second.

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:41.197
Does that mean that the only people
who are disappearing are in Tokyo?

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.449
So, wait.
If this is only happening in Tokyo,

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.744
wouldn't the SDF have come to rescue us?
That makes sense, right?

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.246
And the fact that they haven't come,

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.456
does that mean
that everyone in Japan has disappeared?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.083
The US Army didn't come either.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:53.626
This is so weird.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.212
Could it be
that the whole world disappeared?

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.675
I don't know, man.
I think aliens put chips into our brains

00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:02.135
and are playin' with us.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.804
I don't think anyone could escape
from this place.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.223
Gimme a swig.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.313
The more I hear,
the more depressing it gets.

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:16.024
Yeah, I know…

00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:19.193
Our only hope might be
with those playing cards.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:31.497
All right.
I'll head over to the annex now.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.542
Just be careful, okay?

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.545
I'll also get food supplies and weapons.

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:40.173
And it'll be great
if I could get a little more information.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.306
Yeah, wouldn't that be real nice?

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.899
Hey! You guys mind if I ask you something?

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.945
Wait, I'm not trying to hit on ya!

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:15.601
That's what
this utopia really looks like.

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:20.982
Another Beach rule.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.443
"Death if you're a traitor."

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:39.667
Arisu.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.547
You and Usagi seem to have gathered
a whole bunch of information.

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:46.757
Are you two planning something?

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.595
No, not really.

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.809
All right,
I'll cut to the chase.

00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:01.022
How do you think you're going to live
in a world full of despair?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.691
What?

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:17.538
Look, all I want is some answers.

00:08:19.373 --> 00:08:21.501
Who's behind these sick games and…

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:26.464
who killed my friends, Karube and Chota.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.971
I thought I'd be able to survive

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.308
and go back to the world
the way it used to be.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.896
But if that's not possible,

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.608
I want Usagi to return at the very least.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.570
She's the only reason I'm alive.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:54.325
Very touching.

00:08:57.995 --> 00:08:59.163
This wish of yours…

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:01.874
sure is nice,

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:06.170
but not very practical, I'll tell you.

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:13.636
You'd have to win every single game
coming up and become the next Number 1.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:15.346
Impossible.

00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:18.266
Look, it's not about you guys, all right?

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.810
We think you both have potential.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.523
- What?
- Yeah, that's why we're here right now.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.818
What do you mean?

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.240
What would you say if I told you,
things could play out differently?

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.626
Let's go!

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:52.008
They've got a lot of guns.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:56.345
Their arsenal is in the deepest room
in the annex, and they have patrols too.

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.724
As long as they have all those weapons,

00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:02.184
Hatter will be in control of everything.

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:09.692
What's the matter?

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:19.201
I'm off!

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:27.460
Hatter's making sure
he keeps control of the militant corps,

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.880
but it's only a matter of time
before they retaliate.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.675
And if that happens,

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:38.888
this place will be run
by a bunch of brainless idiots with guns.

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.848
Then it's cut and run.

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:43.768
What are you planning?

00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:48.939
I'm planning
to steal all the playing cards…

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:52.526
bail off the Beach.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.246
Beach.

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.501
A pseudo-utopia
built on one guy's charisma.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:12.463
But then again,

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:16.467
maybe we're the only ones
who think that way.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.968
BEACH

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.305
There is no utopia in this world.

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:24.433
Usagi.

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:28.104
We need to talk.

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:38.698
KABUKICHO

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:40.116
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.799
This way.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.889
Kabuki District, huh?

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:06.976
This takes me back.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.284
{\an8}BEACH

00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:24.785
- I can't wait…
- Watch it!

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.495
- Hey!
- Excuse me, sorry!

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:43.763
Where the hell is that damn GPS chip?

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:50.603
Okay, so this is where you are!

00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:52.188
Did I say you could come in here?

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.984
Right.

00:12:57.067 --> 00:13:00.696
Something bad has happened.
Ju-- Just come with me, please!

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.198
Hurry!

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:10.956
Whoa, what are you doin' here?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.666
What the hell do you two want?

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:14.835
No one asked you to come here!

00:13:16.003 --> 00:13:18.297
Actually, I'm the one who asked him.

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:22.718
Yeah? Who says you can summon people now?

00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:26.055
There's something important
he has to hear.

00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:28.557
Let's go in.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.394
See you later.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.611
What's going on?

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.115
Not a clue, but it's gotta be
something pretty serious.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.452
Apparently, he couldn't clear the game.

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:33.789
The maintenance team
just happened to find him in Shinjuku

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:36.000
while we were filling up with gas.

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:42.506
Hey, do me a favor
and keep your hands off him.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.174
You're obsessed with dissecting things.

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:50.764
This is from a bullet.

00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:54.059
Did the game he was playing involve guns?

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.061
Seems like it.

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.814
Apparently, people around the game area
heard gunshots.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:00.733
Holy shit!

00:15:00.816 --> 00:15:03.652
Looks like he should've brought
the militant corps along with him.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.625
So now what? What happens to the Beach?

00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:21.295
Nobody says a word about this,
understood?

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:23.547
We don't want people freaking out.

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.093
I'll step in as leader since I'm Number 2.

00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:30.054
Wait a second.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.516
Shouldn't the strongest person
be the leader?

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:36.769
In case you didn't know,

00:15:36.852 --> 00:15:39.480
we're the ones who have been
getting rid of the traitors,

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:42.858
but we've been thrown into the shadows
the whole time.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.860
This bullshit ends now, you got that?

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.820
If Number 1 dies,

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:49.782
everyone moves up by a number.
We all knew that.

00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:52.701
Yeah, well, this elitist dictator is dead.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.120
The power has shifted, hasn't it?

00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:59.416
Let's just be democratic
and go with the majority.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:05.422
Who's with me and thinks
that Aguni should be our new leader?

00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:17.977
Are you all serious right now?

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:20.479
Last Boss.

00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:39.832
So I'll ask again.

00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:42.751
Who thinks Aguni should be leader?

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:57.599
This…

00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:00.060
is not a democracy.

00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:03.480
But I think it is, isn't it?

00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:07.401
You can vote however you want, right?

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.705
And how about
the former Number 2 over there?

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.207
What do you think?

00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:34.678
And what about you?

00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:44.730
Chishiya,
you're not looking down on us, are ya?

00:17:45.355 --> 00:17:46.815
Y'all morons in the corps?

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:53.238
Those eyes of yours piss me off sometimes,
you know that?

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:56.909
You really think you're better than us,
don't ya?

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:05.084
I vote for Aguni to be the leader.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:09.338
I'm pretty sure
that's what you want to hear, don't you?

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:16.178
Well, let this be a reminder
of how you should act in the future.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.266
Hey, why are you looking so freaked out?

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:25.312
I thought I told you
to give me an answer there?

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.232
Whose side are you on, anyway?

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:33.403
Just about to shit your pants there, huh?

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:36.073
Look at his face!

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:39.618
All right.

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.704
Looks like we have a unanimous decision.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:45.332
So, we've got a new leader, right?

00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:47.501
Hatter would not allow this.

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:51.213
If he were alive,
he would not have allowed this.

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:55.759
But he's not alive, is he?

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.849
The dead really have no say
as to what's going on. Watch.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.103
See?

00:19:06.728 --> 00:19:08.230
See?

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:11.817
That's enough.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.200
From this day onwards,

00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:23.328
I will be the Beach's new king.

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:28.167
Yeah, let's hear it for the King, huh?

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.342
Okay, boss.
Time for the succession ceremony, right?

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:40.345
Maybe you should open up
the black envelope.

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.399
The black envelope.

00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:57.154
All the playing cards collected
by members of the Beach

00:19:57.946 --> 00:20:00.699
are kept in the safe
in Hatter's royal suite.

00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:04.620
The code for opening the safe

00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:08.749
is sealed inside the black envelope.

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:14.087
The envelope is kept in a secret location.

00:20:16.506 --> 00:20:20.844
And the only time it's opened
is when there's a new Number 1.

00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:29.394
The new Number 1 opens the envelope
in front of the executives,

00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:32.522
but only he sees the code to the safe.

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:45.827
Then, he places the paper
with the code written on it

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.747
into a new envelope and seals it again.

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:52.626
It then must be signed
by all the executives.

00:21:03.303 --> 00:21:05.931
First, Arisu will infiltrate
the royal suite.

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:08.308
Then he'll search for the safe,

00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:10.686
and steal all the playing cards inside.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:15.440
- And how do I get the code?
- Don't worry about that.

00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:19.152
I'll let you know
when you're in front of the safe.

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:23.448
I sure hope you're right.

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:25.617
I'm on it.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.788
Usagi and Kuina will be on the lookout.

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:34.376
This is too dangerous.
They'll kill us if they see us.

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:41.842
I don't think we have any other choice.

00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:47.597
Now that Hatter's dead,
the unity in the Beach is wavering.

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:49.391
I think this plan could work for us.

00:22:03.905 --> 00:22:05.949
I'm here to tell you,
we have a new leader.

00:22:07.951 --> 00:22:08.827
What happened?

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.787
Hatter is no longer with us,

00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:13.665
and that leader has been chosen.

00:22:14.249 --> 00:22:15.667
The new leader is Aguni.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.340
Everybody, shut up!

00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:28.096
It seems as though Hatter failed
in his game. He just couldn't crack it.

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:32.309
A vote was taken,
and the executive was unanimous,

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:35.437
and Aguni was voted as our new Number 1.

00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:40.650
Now, let's hear from Aguni.

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:44.237
You better all listen carefully.

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:53.955
Niragi

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:56.458
said everything that needs to be said.

00:22:58.126 --> 00:23:00.587
All right, the new leader
is making a speech in the lobby.

00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:05.842
All members of the executive
and the militant corps

00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:07.302
are here at the annex.

00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:10.389
We're not gonna get
another chance like this.

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:16.436
I'll let you guys know
if there are any changes here.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.563
I'm counting on you, Arisu.

00:23:20.982 --> 00:23:21.983
Copy that.

00:23:27.114 --> 00:23:29.991
Now that Hatter is gone
and I'm the Number 1,

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:33.412
I have full control over the Beach.

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:37.124
Follow my orders.
I want you to live for me,

00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:40.585
and you may have to die for me.

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:56.059
I found it.

00:23:57.602 --> 00:23:59.146
All right, what's the code?

00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:00.856
8-0-2-2.

00:24:01.356 --> 00:24:03.275
So you saw what's in the letter?

00:24:03.817 --> 00:24:04.860
No.

00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:08.071
But Aguni's expression
pretty much said it all.

00:24:09.364 --> 00:24:10.699
When he opened it,

00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:13.285
his face kinda went all dark,

00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:16.538
like he was completely surprised

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.332
and really perplexed.

00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:23.670
I'm pretty sure
there was nothing written on it.

00:24:24.504 --> 00:24:26.756
Nothing? Then how did you get the code?

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:30.802
From the wax seal.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.390
The Boss seals it with his ring.
It has numbers on it.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.643
And that's the code.

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:41.021
8-0-2-2.

00:24:44.524 --> 00:24:46.651
Sure as hell
wouldn't want to be your enemy.

00:24:57.078 --> 00:24:58.830
It's not opening!

00:25:01.208 --> 00:25:02.417
Chishiya!

00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:05.670
Chishiya, you there?

00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:11.343
Yeah, I gotta hand it to you.
You really got balls.

00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:21.311
- Why would you…
- Let me go!

00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:24.689
- Relax, calm down!
- Usagi!

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.775
Arisu!

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:29.986
Stop crying for your boyfriend,
you stupid bitch!

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.321
Arisu!

00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:37.911
Chishiya, I owe you.

00:25:37.994 --> 00:25:39.913
We wouldn't have caught them
if it wasn't for you.

00:25:39.996 --> 00:25:41.498
- Let go… Arisu!
- Yeah, well…

00:25:41.581 --> 00:25:42.749
Just wanna be of service.

00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:46.586
Stop it! Stop it!

00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:57.639
Arisu!

00:25:58.265 --> 00:26:00.475
Well, now. Looks like…

00:26:02.018 --> 00:26:03.853
Someone's gone night-night.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.944
All right. Bring him to the room.

00:26:28.878 --> 00:26:32.674
Well, rumor has it
that your visa expires tomorrow.

00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:41.182
Without your sense of hearing
or your sight, you're like a sitting duck.

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:44.978
I can just imagine the terror
you're feeling as you sit here

00:26:45.061 --> 00:26:47.480
and wait for the laser
to burn through your skull!

00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:52.152
But for now…

00:26:52.235 --> 00:26:56.448
…I'll just enjoy all this precious time
I'm gonna have with your girlfriend.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.244
See ya!

00:28:01.554 --> 00:28:03.807
How are things going over there, Kuina?

00:28:05.558 --> 00:28:08.687
All right, I guess.
Aguni is still in his room.

00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:12.607
I'm dying of boredom over here.

00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:16.986
Well, let's go ahead with our plan, then.

00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:22.075
I have no idea
if Arisu is smart or stupid.

00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:25.453
There's no way
they'd keep the cards in an ordinary safe.

00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:29.582
Then where do you think
the real safe is?

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:33.586
I'm not sure,
but when Arisu found the fake safe,

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:36.923
Aguni, who usually has a good poker face,

00:28:37.507 --> 00:28:39.676
was glancing towards something else.

00:28:43.012 --> 00:28:46.349
I think that whatever's in that envelope

00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:50.145
isn't a code or some blank letter.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.984
I think it might just be a drawing.

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:20.800
Found it.

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:23.428
So this is
why you sacrificed them?

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:28.850
Yeah, well, you gotta give something
to get something.

00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:33.021
They were pawns, that's all. Shit happens.

00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:36.524
Yeah, well, all I know…

00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:40.904
is that I sure as hell
wouldn't want to be your enemy.

00:29:42.155 --> 00:29:43.656
Yeah, I get that a lot.

00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:50.390
- Get your hands off me!
- Shut up!

00:30:50.473 --> 00:30:52.559
- Hurry…
- Stop struggling, man!

00:30:52.642 --> 00:30:53.643
And, heave!

00:30:53.726 --> 00:30:54.644
Now relax.

00:30:57.564 --> 00:30:59.399
- Stop resisting.
- Get off me!

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:35.435
Rape, assault, fraud, arson, and murder.

00:31:36.686 --> 00:31:39.355
Why do you think
these things are all against the law?

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:49.073
You tell me, why do you think
they're all against the law?

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:56.331
Because they're all in our nature.

00:32:00.209 --> 00:32:03.796
Left to their own devices, humans will
rape, steal, and kill each other.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.052
Because that's what we're all about.

00:32:20.563 --> 00:32:23.107
But there are no laws here, are there?

00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:27.111
It's a waste to deny our basic instincts,
don't you think?

00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:29.489
I mean, it's inside us all.

00:32:30.156 --> 00:32:32.492
It even empowers us, doesn't it?

00:33:01.354 --> 00:33:02.689
Don't fuck with me.

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.403
The fun is just starting.

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:34.887
Well, I guess
I can get rid of this now, too.

00:33:36.139 --> 00:33:40.601
Don't you feel sorry for him?
Arisu, I mean.

00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:42.729
Sorry for him?

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:46.607
Hmm. Yeah, I know I do.

00:33:51.571 --> 00:33:54.240
Sometimes we have to do things
in order to survive.

00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:03.708
If you're so worried about him,
then you should help him.

00:34:15.094 --> 00:34:16.137
No way…

00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:20.183
W-- Wait!

00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:40.078
Seriously?

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.145
We would like to take this opportunity

00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:10.525
to sincerely thank you for staying
at Seaside Paradise, Tokyo.

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:13.236
As a token of our appreciation,

00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:18.491
we will now commence a game
with all 58 participants in the venue.

00:35:18.574 --> 00:35:20.118
{\an8}1 PER PERSON

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:24.580
THE GAME WILL NOW COMMENCE

00:35:29.752 --> 00:35:30.878
The Beach is…

00:35:31.879 --> 00:35:33.172
a game arena?

00:35:33.756 --> 00:35:35.591
Difficulty,

00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:37.009
Ten of Hearts.

00:35:37.093 --> 00:35:38.052
GAME DIFFICULTY

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:43.266
- "Ten of Hearts"!
- It happened at last.

00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:50.648
All participants
must assemble in the lobby immediately.

00:35:50.731 --> 00:35:54.026
The rules of the game
will then be explained.

00:35:56.028 --> 00:35:59.699
I repeat. All participants must assemble

00:35:59.782 --> 00:36:01.951
in the lobby immediately.

00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:26.058
Hey, there's a game
starting in the lobby!

00:36:26.142 --> 00:36:27.727
- Let's go!
- Hurry!

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.979
- Quick!
- Anyone know what game it is?

00:36:30.062 --> 00:36:31.564
It's Ten of Hearts!

00:36:31.647 --> 00:36:34.066
Hurry up! Hurry, hurry. Come on!

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.151
Move it!

00:37:15.983 --> 00:37:17.068
Momoka!

00:37:18.444 --> 00:37:20.988
Momoka! Why…

00:37:27.954 --> 00:37:30.706
Game, "Witch Hunt".

00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:34.877
The murderous witch who killed this girl

00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:37.296
is hiding amongst you in plain sight.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.260
The witch role is not limited to women.

00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:44.595
She's hiding here?

00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:47.390
To clear the game,
you must find the witch

00:37:47.473 --> 00:37:50.476
and burn him or her
in the Fire of Judgment.

00:37:51.143 --> 00:37:53.604
Time limit, two hours.

00:38:25.928 --> 00:38:27.805
TIME LIMIT
