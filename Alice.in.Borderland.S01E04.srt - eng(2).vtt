00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:49.632
Easy, little guy.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.782
What's he doing?

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:37.889
You wanna live?

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.071
I'm just…

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:55.990
I wanna die in here.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:01:59.911
Yeah?

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.664
I get it.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.409
Thank you for this meal.

LIFE IN THE WOODS
BY HENRY DAVID THOREAU

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.885
It's so beautiful.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.264
Yes.

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:10.059
Dad…

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.605
Let's say there really was a God.

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:17.191
What would you ask for?

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.945
Aah…

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:24.282
Hmm…

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:30.621
That there would be
more mountains for us to climb!

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.082
Where no human being has ever been.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.083
Please, dear God!

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.922
You're crazy.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:45.803
Mountains like that don't exist
in the world today, Yuzuha.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.181
Your turn, now.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.522
I want this moment to last forever!

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:04.822
A mountaintop…

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.200
is where I…

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:12.205
A mountaintop is
where I can really be myself.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.834
Dad, you are the only one

00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:20.338
who makes me believe
that I have a place in this world.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.887
I wanna live this moment forever.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.810
You'd get bored.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:50.785
That's his daughter!

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:53.538
- There she is!
- Ms. Usagi! Ms. Usagi!

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.376
- I just wanna ask you…
- Did he actually climb Mount Everest?

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.670
Is it true that your father didn't
actually make the climb

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:01.587
that he said he did?

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.048
Please… Ms. Usagi, Ms. Usagi, over here!

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:06.175
Please comment, please!

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.053
Welcome home.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.307
Dad.

00:07:14.892 --> 00:07:16.185
Don't you worry.

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.021
I don't know who's spreading these lies,

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.691
but I've always told you the truth.

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:30.783
Where are you going?

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:32.869
To the mountain.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.385
Dad, wait.

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:54.724
The mountain…

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.227
is where I can really be myself.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:27.131
STAGED?

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:30.134
SOLO NO-OXYGEN MOUNTAIN CLIMBING
SUSPECTED TO BE STAGED

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.637
HE USED AN OXYGEN SUPPLEMENT

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.640
IT WAS AN IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE
IN THE FIRST PLACE

00:08:35.723 --> 00:08:39.018
DID USAGI STAGE THE ENTIRE EVENT?

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:42.146
550-STRONG SEARCH PARTY
LOOK FOR MISSING CLIMBER

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:48.903
NO CLUES ON HIS WHEREABOUTS

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:51.447
{\an8}WORLD-FAMOUS MOUNTAINEER MISSING

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.157
DID SHIGENORI USAGI
COMMIT SUICIDE

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.159
DUE TO SUSPICIONS
ON STAGED MOUNTAIN CLIMBING?

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:58.871
SUICIDE

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:03.477
Thank you for the meal.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.826
Why did you save me?

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.424
Your body says, "I want to live."

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:37.428
My body?

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.267
Might say it wants to live…

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:52.693
But I don't deserve to live anymore.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.158
They're all dead.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.955
And I'm the only one still alive.

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:11.170
They all had to die so I could survive.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.302
I might as well have been the one
who killed them all.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.391
I killed them all.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.021
I don't deserve to live.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:32.108
Not after I let them all die.

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:36.654
I have to die.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.032
I have to die.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:42.868
I have to die!

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.456
I have to die to be with them.

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:53.629
I need to die!
I need to make it up to all of them!

00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:58.134
I need to make amends
for everything I've done!

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:09.687
Why?

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.733
Why?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.741
I…

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:26.829
I'm hungry.

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:34.712
I understand.

00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:38.007
There was a time I wanted to die too.

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:44.722
Just like you do.

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:49.268
I was just laying on the ground.

00:12:50.978 --> 00:12:52.980
And I started feeling hungry.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.155
I know one day, I will die.

00:13:04.992 --> 00:13:07.828
And it could be
when we're playing the game tomorrow

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.372
or when my visa expires.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.340
But for now, I made that food.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.010
So eat it while you're still alive.

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:51.599
Get ready.

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:57.938
You've got a game to play.

00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:05.613
Are you planning to die
by having your visa expire?

00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:20.377
That time you screamed at all of us.

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:28.969
During the tag game…

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:34.850
You risked your life
trying to save everyone.

00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:37.102
- Everyone!
- Hey!

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:39.813
He's up here! Over here,
he's on the second level!

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:42.066
Tell us where he is if you see him!

00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:44.068
And let's all look for the symbol!

00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:50.991
I didn't wanna die then.

00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:59.333
And I didn't want anyone else too, either.

00:16:04.254 --> 00:16:05.673
I know what you're saying.

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.385
And I don't want you to die now.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:16.475
If you hadn't screamed back there,
I'd be dead now.

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:28.862
Let me repay you.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.944
{\an8}THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:10.279
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:13.949
THE GAME ARENA IS UP AHEAD

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.368
THIS WAY TO THE GAME ARENA

00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:55.425
1 PER PERSON

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:09.106
{\an8}FACE RECOGNITION IN PROGRESS
PLEASE WAIT FOR A MOMENT

00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:12.109
You're not newbies.

00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:16.029
And who are you?

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:19.408
We're the guys
who cleared four games together.

00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:23.871
We met at the first game
and now we work together as a team.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:28.500
But we might need more
if we're gonna clear this one.

00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:33.172
And your leg? Are you hurt?

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:38.969
Ah… I tweaked it a bit.

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:41.471
In the game?

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.684
Yeah.

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.274
Okay, the game's starting.

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:54.735
Registration is now closed.

00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:57.112
The game is about to commence.

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.448
Difficulty, Four of Clubs.

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:02.701
There are a total of five participants.

00:20:02.784 --> 00:20:04.411
Game, "Distance".

00:20:04.494 --> 00:20:06.413
"Distance"?

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:11.293
Rule. Endure the trial
while striving for the goal

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:12.878
within the time limit.

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:14.796
Clear condition.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.466
Safely attain the goal.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.218
What is this?

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:21.470
The game will now commence.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:24.932
{\an8}120 minutes remaining.

00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:29.770
Does this mean we have to run?

00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.397
What do you think, Seizan?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.526
{\an8}"Distance"?

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:38.904
Zero.

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:44.243
We have to run? On the highway?

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:48.288
Uh, run?

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.582
Takuma. Just relax.

00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:53.210
Sit down, sit down.

00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:56.922
I think these old buses
from the '70s all have V8 engines.

00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:02.010
Let's hope it starts.

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.137
Come on, baby!

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:09.977
Shit! It's out of gas.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.230
Looks like we have to run.

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:20.862
Go on. Leave me here.

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.747
- Takuma!
- Listen to me.

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:34.793
I don't plan to just sit on my ass here,
roll over, and die.

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.131
I'm gonna try to find a way to survive.

00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:42.175
But you gotta go.

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:49.016
- We're not leaving you behind!
- Yamane!

00:21:51.184 --> 00:21:53.395
You gotta survive, so go now!

00:21:54.604 --> 00:21:56.398
You wanna see your wife again, right?

00:21:57.441 --> 00:21:59.860
And what about that baby she's carrying?

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.614
What the hell are they supposed to do
without you?

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:14.499
Don't worry about me. I got this.

00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:24.593
Yamane.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.721
Let's go.

00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:33.977
Go on.

00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:36.813
Now.

00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:38.899
You can do this.

00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:49.993
Let's go.

00:22:58.627 --> 00:22:59.711
Let's go.

00:23:10.263 --> 00:23:11.932
He made the right choice.

00:23:22.442 --> 00:23:25.153
110 minutes remaining.

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:52.097
Arisu.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.348
Live for us.

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:55.183
Thank you.

00:24:23.503 --> 00:24:25.297
Distance, 1,000.

00:24:34.723 --> 00:24:37.851
90 minutes remaining.

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:40.562
To reach the goal,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.440
how much further do we have to run?

00:24:55.452 --> 00:24:58.872
Distance, 5,000.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.630
Hey.

00:25:07.422 --> 00:25:08.632
What's that?

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:16.932
REPLENISHMENT STATION

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:23.647
We made it.

00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:32.614
Wait.

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:34.533
- Hang on a sec.
- Eh?

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.287
You're waiting for us to drink it,
aren't you?

00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:43.959
No, we're not.

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:53.552
Drink this.

00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:55.679
Thank you.

00:26:07.857 --> 00:26:09.025
That was great.

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:18.785
Are you sure?

00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:20.662
Uh-huh.

00:26:38.888 --> 00:26:41.808
Distance, 6,000.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.313
Man, it's dark in here.

00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:57.741
Shit, this isn't Clubs.
It's gotta be a game of Spades.

00:27:01.369 --> 00:27:02.954
Something's over there.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.297
I don't see anything.

00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:14.883
Yeah. Right there.

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:34.569
Run!

00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:28.558
Oh my god, oh my god. Help me!

00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.026
Help!

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.155
No! Get off!

00:29:42.238 --> 00:29:43.323
Seizan!

00:29:43.406 --> 00:29:44.866
- Let's go!
- Come on!

00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:45.784
Get off!

00:29:48.703 --> 00:29:51.164
Seizan! Seizan!

00:29:56.085 --> 00:29:58.588
- I can't run anymore.
- Come on!

00:30:02.342 --> 00:30:03.426
I'm done.

00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:07.847
I can't.

00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:15.522
I'd only been with them…

00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:18.358
for about a week, but…

00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:23.071
it's like I knew them both…

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.241
for my entire life.

00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:36.334
You gotta live.

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:38.837
So you can tell your wife about them.

00:30:49.722 --> 00:30:50.723
You're right.

00:31:03.778 --> 00:31:06.948
Distance, 8,000.

00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:23.089
What are you doing?

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.133
A motorcycle.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.387
Royal Enfield.

00:31:31.514 --> 00:31:32.765
You know bikes?

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:36.227
Diesel engines like that are pretty rare.

00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:43.192
But old stuff like this still works

00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:46.195
since none of it has any IC chips.

00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:49.699
Hang on.

00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:51.951
Electronics.

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:55.872
All electrical circuits
have been destroyed.

00:31:56.956 --> 00:31:57.790
So?

00:31:57.874 --> 00:32:01.044
Analog stuff
with no electrical circuitry still works.

00:32:01.127 --> 00:32:03.379
All motorcycles and all the cars
still work.

00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:06.382
Like this bike, or that bus back there!

00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:12.805
Damn it, no battery.

00:32:15.183 --> 00:32:18.061
This bike, you said it's got
an old diesel engine, right?

00:32:18.144 --> 00:32:19.187
Uh-huh.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.648
So it doesn't run on regular gas,
but diesel.

00:32:22.231 --> 00:32:24.317
- So does the bus, nice!
- Uh-huh.

00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:27.570
Wait, so…

00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:30.239
You want to carry that bike
all the way back with you?

00:32:30.323 --> 00:32:33.910
If we get this fuel back there,
we can use the bus and save Takuma.

00:32:33.993 --> 00:32:35.703
You wanna save Takuma?

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:37.455
- Uh-huh.
- But if we go back,

00:32:37.538 --> 00:32:39.290
then the game can't be cleared!

00:32:39.374 --> 00:32:41.751
Yes it can. There's still enough time.

00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:44.754
But just in case, you two keep going.

00:32:44.837 --> 00:32:47.632
If I can start that bus,
I'll catch up real fast.

00:32:48.925 --> 00:32:51.219
No more surviving
by letting other people die.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.262
I'm done with it.

00:33:13.574 --> 00:33:16.995
Distance, 7,000.

00:33:22.291 --> 00:33:25.545
Distance, 10,000.

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:39.100
Distance, 6,000.

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:43.438
Distance, 12,000.

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:52.071
Distance, 4,000.

00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:06.252
What?

00:34:08.588 --> 00:34:09.630
That's the goal.

00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:15.470
All right, let's wait for them.

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:26.773
Distance, 1,000.

00:34:31.194 --> 00:34:34.864
15 minutes remaining.

00:34:37.283 --> 00:34:38.576
Hey!

00:34:46.834 --> 00:34:48.127
Hey!

00:34:57.053 --> 00:34:58.429
Hey!

00:35:11.984 --> 00:35:15.696
ENTRY PROHIBITED

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.206
Your wife?

00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:35.091
This autumn, we're expecting a baby.

00:35:45.852 --> 00:35:48.020
I'm sure
they're waiting for you somewhere.

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:54.944
Somewhere…

00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:58.447
they're waiting.

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:03.661
Everyone's waiting.

00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:10.543
They're all out there somewhere.

00:36:18.718 --> 00:36:20.720
So you have to stay alive to see them.

00:36:33.149 --> 00:36:36.027
Five minutes remaining.

00:36:36.569 --> 00:36:38.112
Doesn't look like they made it.

00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:46.829
What the hell was that?

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:53.044
What is that?

00:37:02.762 --> 00:37:03.679
Water?

00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:56.232
I can't run anymore!

00:37:56.315 --> 00:37:58.818
Yes, you can! Don't look back!

00:38:01.862 --> 00:38:02.822
Ah!

00:38:27.763 --> 00:38:28.848
Usagi!

00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:37.398
Arisu!

00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:26.655
Arisu.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.971
Oh, it hurts.

00:39:54.517 --> 00:39:55.810
Are you all right?

00:40:10.866 --> 00:40:12.785
Thank you. Thanks.

00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:35.724
Goal.

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:39.603
So this whole time…

00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:43.315
I was at the goal?

00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:49.530
It was right there for us to see.

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:52.491
The bus was the goal from the very start.

00:40:53.659 --> 00:40:56.328
Then what were all those numbers about?

00:40:56.412 --> 00:40:57.955
The distance to the goal.

00:40:59.373 --> 00:41:00.916
We were safe at zero.

00:41:09.925 --> 00:41:11.510
Game cleared.

00:41:11.594 --> 00:41:13.888
Congratulations.

00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:20.436
I got you.

00:41:34.617 --> 00:41:36.494
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:44.502
I, uh…

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:47.838
I have no idea.

00:41:56.138 --> 00:41:57.640
But I hope that…

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:03.229
we'll meet again.

00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:35.052
The Beach?

00:42:36.178 --> 00:42:38.889
Maybe the people
who disappeared are there.

00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:41.892
Could it be
some kind of evacuation shelter?

00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:43.894
Yeah, maybe.

00:42:45.271 --> 00:42:47.064
But there's an answer out there.

00:42:49.525 --> 00:42:51.735
And I wanna remember Karube's words.

00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:55.614
I'm gonna do it for everyone.

00:42:57.283 --> 00:42:59.827
I'm gonna find the mastermind
of this sick game.

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:02.955
And get this world back to the way it was.

00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:06.584
I swear it.

00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:14.216
But to do that,
I have to head to the Beach.

00:43:40.576 --> 00:43:42.411
You really don't know how to ride a bike?

00:43:43.245 --> 00:43:44.496
I never learned how.

00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:46.915
That's pretty hard to believe.

00:43:51.337 --> 00:43:53.339
But this feels nice.
