00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.301
These cookies taste better.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.014
Hey,

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.142
would you mind telling me
what my symbol is?

00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:09.277
That guy you hang out with?

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.614
You should know that he's a murderer.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.534
- What?
- His name's Sunato Banda.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:18.995
It was in the newspaper.

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:23.208
Murdered four women, so,
that makes him a serial killer.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:26.669
And, you know, that's punishable by death.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.547
That's a filthy lie.

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:30.799
No. It's true.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.468
Know what I think?

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.845
I think he's the Jack of Hearts.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.808
There's only five of us left.

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:42.227
Time is running out,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.729
so the Jack's gonna start
to get aggressive now.

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.274
Might as well share symbols.

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:55.990
For the moment, you're in a good position.

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:59.327
The Jack still trusts you.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.664
So if anyone is going to lie to the Jack,

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:03.915
it has to be you.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.209
Which means

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.962
this game can only end one way.

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:11.422
The key player here is you.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.722
I'm sure this is a lot,
and you don't trust me yet.

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:24.060
For what it's worth,
there's no advantage for me to lie,

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.354
so I'll tell you the truth
about your symbol.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:30.150
Don't you wanna make sure
that Banda's telling you the truth?

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:34.946
What makes you think
that I would trust you over him?

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:37.866
You don't have to if you don't want to.

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.286
If I were in your shoes,
I'd want to weigh my options.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.706
And I've got no reason to lie to you.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.209
Banda's a murderer, and that's a fact.

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:52.922
I still don't trust you.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.465
Fine.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:58.344
You'll see for yourself,
once the next round is over.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.931
You're a spade, just so you know.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.188
So, will you tell me mine?

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:16.237
Come on. I told you what yours is.

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.324
I never agreed to this deal.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:27.999
Heart.

00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:43.765
What's happening?

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:53.733
I think the Jack of Hearts is…

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.110
is that guy right there.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.116
I thought he was suspicious too.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.495
Well, don't worry.

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:10.124
He'll die this round.
You can trust me on that.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.471
That kid Banda.

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:28.768
He's the one we need to watch out for.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.692
You know that emo kid
who lied first to kill that big guy?

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.320
Banda's the one
who convinced him to lie to the man.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.823
- I saw him do it.
- Huh?

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:45.410
He whispered in his ear.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:52.333
Banda looks innocent, but he's got
no actual empathy for anyone else.

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:56.587
He can only process human emotion
through logic and reason.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.718
He's certifiably psychopathic.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.432
He's the Jack of Hearts. I'm sure of it.

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:08.094
There are only five of us left,

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.972
and unfortunately, my partner's dead.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.352
I asked that guy Matsushita
what my symbol is,

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.354
but he told me he doesn't trust me,

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:22.024
and I'm pretty sure that he lied to me.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.651
Sort of a hunch, I guess.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:29.115
So, would you mind
telling me what my symbol is?

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.659
I know this is kind of a big ask.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.914
But if you want, I promise to tell you
your symbol in exchange.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.001
I… don't mean to presume,

00:07:40.084 --> 00:07:43.421
but you strike me as an honest person,
at least from over here.

00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:52.722
Also, that Yaba guy strikes me
as a bit of a conman,

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.434
and since you're aligned with him,
I thought you should know.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.992
Let me get right to the point.

00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:15.953
Are you the Jack of Hearts or not?

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.749
I'll only say this.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.376
I might be the Jack of Hearts,

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:26.297
but the fact that you're bringing it up
means it could be you.

00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:34.096
I know one thing.
You and I will never get along.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:37.600
Your symbol

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.019
is a heart.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.147
Now, what about mine?

00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:46.234
It's a club, right?

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:58.496
These taste better, you know.

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:50.423
Five people left,
and only two pairs.

00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:52.883
The Jack's definitely going
to make a move this round.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.010
Yeah…

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:07.773
I guess that this is the last round.

00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:26.626
Heart.

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.468
Thank you very much.

00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:48.397
Diamond.

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:00.910
Spade.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:14.340
All right, and now it's my turn.

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:20.513
Spade.

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:26.143
It is time to answer.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:30.815
Please enter a solitary confinement
cell of your choosing.

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.372
I bet Matsushita lied to me.

00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:47.832
I'm sure he did.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.169
And Kotoko, she totally ignored me.

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:56.966
Meaning that… it's a diamond,

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.843
or a spade, right?

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.346
Hmm.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.265
Ah, well…

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:07.184
I'll go with my gut.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.288
Please give your answer.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.754
I won.

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:19.840
Huh!

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:40.903
I had a feeling
you were the Jack of Hearts.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:44.782
But how did you…

00:13:44.865 --> 00:13:46.742
You teamed up with Banda from the start,

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.245
and he's a murderer,
so it just made sense.

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:51.914
We should be a team.

00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:56.544
Even if somehow,

00:13:57.127 --> 00:13:59.630
you were moved
by Banda's little monologue,

00:13:59.713 --> 00:14:01.590
I knew you wouldn't trust him.

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:04.969
You don't trust strangers.
And certainly not as fast as that.

00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:10.099
Most people
won't even talk to a guy like me.

00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:11.976
But you wanted to kill me.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.064
I could sense that in you right away.

00:14:17.147 --> 00:14:20.526
So I wanted to see if you were smart,
or just stupid,

00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:22.570
or whether you were a true psychopath.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:24.738
You mean…

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:28.367
You thought you were controlling me
this whole time.

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:32.663
But I was manipulating you
into thinking that way.

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:38.627
Ultimately, it was your huge
superiority complex that gave you away.

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:42.631
That kind of self-importance
usually comes

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.633
from being put in a special position.

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:46.802
Something that made you feel untouchable.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.263
Like being chosen as the Jack.

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:51.307
You guys are wrong about this.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.810
- Banda is the Jack of Hearts!
- Sorry, kid.

00:14:59.648 --> 00:15:00.941
It's not Banda.

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.621
You and Kotoko were connected.

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:17.041
I told Kotoko what her symbol was.

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:20.210
And yet, she still died.

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:28.552
Which means Kotoko was being manipulated
by someone other than me.

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:31.805
Well, then,

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.725
you should be accusing this guy instead.

00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:36.852
Every time I went to the cafeteria,

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:41.982
you and Kotoko would always be there,
getting snacks at the same time.

00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:44.151
This break
couldn't come soon enough.

00:15:44.234 --> 00:15:46.236
- I don't…
- I'm scared. Aren't you?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.989
- When you trust…
- I don't know what's going on.

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:51.075
I don't know if I can keep doing this.

00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:52.618
You can trust me.

00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:55.454
Every time I get through it,
I think, "I made it."

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:57.623
And each time,

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:01.001
you'd get the exact same kind of snack.

00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:12.638
You and Kotoko were secretly
communicating in the cafeteria.

00:16:12.721 --> 00:16:13.681
Spade.

00:16:15.557 --> 00:16:19.812
Both of you were just pretending
that you were being controlled.

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:30.698
There were four different flavors
of the snack.

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:35.411
You would confirm your symbols
by checking the packaging,

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.664
using those snacks
as a code with each other.

00:16:38.747 --> 00:16:40.332
I caught on pretty quickly.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:57.975
And then,

00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:01.478
you told Kotoko
to give me the wrong symbol.

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:03.564
Diamond.

00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:08.902
I really did trust her.

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:12.740
Except at the end.

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.911
When did the three of you guys
start working together?

00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:21.123
Well, the very first announcement said

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:24.251
that this game is about
how much we can trust one another.

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:27.379
So we simply followed that principle.

00:17:29.798 --> 00:17:32.593
In order to gain someone's trust,
you can't

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:36.805
control, or manipulate,
or guide them in any way.

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:40.559
You can't brainwash or hypnotize them,

00:17:40.642 --> 00:17:42.853
lie to them or instill fear.

00:17:45.939 --> 00:17:47.399
It's called equality.

00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:55.991
I know one thing.

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:57.951
You and I will never get along.

00:17:58.827 --> 00:17:59.912
Tell me.

00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:02.915
I want to know

00:18:03.957 --> 00:18:06.794
why you're here
playing the games in this country?

00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:12.841
I'll tell you why I'm here.

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.719
I've never seen a place
more beautiful than this one.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.225
I'm here because I…

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:25.854
because I believe that this world
is a place that is worth conquering.

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:32.736
Well, then, you and I might be
more alike than you think.

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:39.451
I'm starting
to get that feeling too.

00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:43.413
Trust is the most important thing
in this game.

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.794
We'll be good for each other.

00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:52.339
Intellectual equals,
and trustworthy partners.

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:01.765
Wait a sec.
What makes you so sure it's me?

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:04.518
The Jack of Hearts
could easily be one of you guys.

00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:08.438
Okay, maybe I did try to blame everything
on you by setting you up, but look!

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:09.898
But that's not enough, huh?

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:13.110
You guys don't have any proof
that I'm the Jack of Hearts, huh?

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.654
- You sure about that?
- Huh?

00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:18.115
Just think about it.

00:19:18.198 --> 00:19:22.870
If they suspected that you were the Jack,
then why did you survive this last round?

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:26.582
Why didn't Banda lie?
Tell you the wrong thing?

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:29.543
The reason you're still alive
is because you're the Jack.

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:37.092
And these guys planned to keep you alive

00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:41.388
because they decided they wanna
get information out of you.

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:58.530
Round 14, start.

00:20:02.784 --> 00:20:03.785
What are you doing?

00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:07.789
There have been so few opportunities

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:10.542
to really get to talk
to the citizens of this place.

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:13.587
We need you to tell us
the ins and outs of this country.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.845
I'm sorry that
we won't be able to kill you, but…

00:20:24.514 --> 00:20:26.725
there are a lot of other ways to have fun.

00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:22.447
We didn't get very much out of him.

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:27.035
I can't believe he just gave up
like that and said the wrong answer,

00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:30.706
even though we told him
what the real answer was.

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:35.085
He certainly gave up
faster than I expected.

00:21:35.168 --> 00:21:36.586
Hmm. Yeah.

00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:51.393
My name is Kaito Kameyama.

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:53.895
- Fireworks…
- I'll try to get out.

00:21:55.105 --> 00:21:56.648
It's lots of fun here.

00:21:57.357 --> 00:22:01.445
There are no laws,
so we can loot and kill as we please.

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:03.739
When I play the games,

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:06.116
It's like,"I don't fuckin' care!"

00:22:06.199 --> 00:22:07.242
Total freedom. Oh yeah!

00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:10.037
It feels pretty great.

00:22:11.913 --> 00:22:13.332
I hate it here.

00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:16.835
That's why I'm smoking weed…

00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:20.422
…and just flipping out!

00:22:23.383 --> 00:22:25.010
What is this world?

00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:28.138
What are these games?

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.682
Who's behind all of this?

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:33.435
You guys are fucking crazy.

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:34.686
I'm gonna kill you!

00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:38.732
Hey! Stop filming and help me here!

00:22:38.815 --> 00:22:40.525
It's okay!

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:41.902
What the fuck are you doing?

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:44.863
- Come here! I'm gonna kill you!
- Wait! Don't--

00:22:44.946 --> 00:22:46.239
- I'm gonna--
- Hey! Don't!

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:54.539
Life is totally meaningless here.

00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.504
Human beings are worthless.

00:23:02.589 --> 00:23:04.966
Is that what this world
is trying to tell us?

00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:32.077
Arisu. Do it.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.787
Do we go back where we came from?

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.622
Otherwise everyone will die!

00:23:54.182 --> 00:23:55.016
There.

00:23:55.725 --> 00:23:56.685
Thank you.

00:24:03.066 --> 00:24:04.151
You know…

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:10.073
when Kyuma and I were talking
at the end of the game,

00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:13.493
I figured something out.

00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:18.290
They were all players to begin with,

00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:21.168
and then eventually,

00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:24.588
they started making the games themselves.

00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:30.510
I mean that…

00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:34.306
we might not be able

00:24:35.223 --> 00:24:36.641
to ever get home…

00:24:39.186 --> 00:24:41.563
even if we beat every single game.

00:24:45.108 --> 00:24:46.318
Because…

00:24:48.653 --> 00:24:51.448
our world might not even exist anymore.

00:24:54.701 --> 00:24:55.827
Which means that…

00:24:57.871 --> 00:24:59.706
Tatta sacrificed himself

00:25:01.124 --> 00:25:02.501
for nothing.

00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:19.017
That might not be true.

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:23.396
There might still be a way to get back.

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:25.941
I'll keep trying.

00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:29.194
I'll keep playing the games.

00:25:31.905 --> 00:25:33.782
Tatta won't have died in vain.

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:48.296
Are you really going?

00:25:49.005 --> 00:25:51.216
I'm worried
about Ann and Chishiya.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.552
I'm gonna go look for them.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.349
We need more friends if we're gonna
take down the King of Spades.

00:26:00.433 --> 00:26:02.227
And the more games that we beat,

00:26:03.144 --> 00:26:05.146
the closer we'll be to our goal.

00:26:08.191 --> 00:26:09.526
Don't worry.

00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:11.486
We'll see each other again.

00:26:13.154 --> 00:26:14.155
Usagi.

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:16.950
You need to rest.

00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:22.622
Arisu. Take care of Usagi.

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:28.712
Well, be safe.

00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:21.848
You know,

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:25.018
I'd be down with going
to a deserted island.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.940
I'd be down with zombies
showing up in Shibuya.

00:27:31.024 --> 00:27:33.902
Everyone here gets bitten,
and they all turn into zombies!

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:36.488
Stop it with the zombie talk, will ya?

00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:39.699
If zombies did show up here,
only Karube would survive.

00:27:39.783 --> 00:27:42.077
You'd knock 'em out with one punch.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.495
I doubt that.

00:27:43.578 --> 00:27:45.580
You'd be the one to survive, Arisu.

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:46.998
Me? Why's that?

00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:50.627
Because I know you'd outsmart 'em.

00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:03.264
What?

00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:06.893
Why are you acting like your life is over?

00:28:07.977 --> 00:28:08.978
Huh?

00:28:10.146 --> 00:28:12.982
Why are you making that face?
You look like it's the end of the world.

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:16.444
I was wondering what was on your mind.

00:28:16.986 --> 00:28:19.197
So fuckin' stupid.

00:28:20.448 --> 00:28:21.700
Is your life so pathetic

00:28:21.783 --> 00:28:24.244
that getting a job
will be the end of the world for you?

00:28:24.327 --> 00:28:25.578
Don't worry so much.

00:28:25.662 --> 00:28:27.288
Use your dad's connections.

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:30.875
Just do whatever you have to do
and leave the deep thoughts for later.

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:32.711
Arisu,

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.923
sometimes life
seems like it's at a dead end,

00:28:37.006 --> 00:28:40.802
but there's always another path
you can take, even when things go wrong.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.888
Huh?

00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:50.520
Not really convincing coming from
a part-time bartender, though.

00:28:50.603 --> 00:28:53.106
Do you have anything smart
to add? I highly doubt it.

00:28:53.189 --> 00:28:54.899
Let me see…

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.819
See, you got nothin'.

00:28:57.902 --> 00:29:00.488
- What you said was still really cool.
- Shut up.

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:03.575
- Hard to do on the spot.
- Don't give me your shit.

00:29:03.658 --> 00:29:06.619
- See?
- Keep your mouth shut, then.

00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:43.573
Oh.

00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:47.494
Mugwort.

00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:18.233
Hey, do you wanna come hunting?

00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:22.111
We don't have any food left.

00:30:23.738 --> 00:30:25.240
I managed to pick this,

00:30:26.032 --> 00:30:28.034
but we won't survive on plants alone.

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:39.337
Hey!

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.008
If you wanna eat meat,
then you need to help.

00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:07.615
Arisu! Get it!

00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:32.265
Arisu, would you get serious about this?

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:36.561
We don't have food for tonight.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:47.071
Arisu, look! Over there!

00:31:52.535 --> 00:31:53.411
Ah!

00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:01.336
It's there! Look, look!

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.801
Ah! Aah!

00:32:09.302 --> 00:32:10.178
Uh…

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.222
Oh, there's one.

00:32:21.564 --> 00:32:24.192
Ah, you were so close!

00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:26.402
You're terrible at this, you know?

00:32:29.864 --> 00:32:31.991
Shit.

00:32:32.492 --> 00:32:33.368
Huh.

00:32:35.536 --> 00:32:37.246
- What?
- Over there!

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:38.706
This way? Oh!

00:32:39.415 --> 00:32:40.833
- Usagi, it's there!
- Huh?

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:43.127
Ah!

00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:44.754
Arisu!

00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:46.381
Oh, shoot!

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:49.217
Arisu, there it is.

00:32:55.264 --> 00:32:56.307
Ah!

00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:58.184
Oh, man. I give up.

00:32:59.352 --> 00:33:00.937
Damn it.

00:33:01.604 --> 00:33:03.147
No meat for you, I guess, huh?

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.984
Oh, I'm starving.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.909
Come on.

00:35:03.684 --> 00:35:04.894
Are you okay?

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:10.483
Film…

00:35:11.484 --> 00:35:13.319
- Huh?
- What film?

00:35:31.921 --> 00:35:34.006
In here?

00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.908
He must have been a photographer.

00:36:06.706 --> 00:36:08.291
This is eight millimeter film.

00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:12.712
Do you watch it with this?

00:36:54.462 --> 00:36:56.130
My name is Kaito Kameyama.

00:36:57.089 --> 00:36:59.717
For some reason,
electronic devices don't work here.

00:37:00.676 --> 00:37:04.472
So I'm using this eight millimeter camera
to make a record of this place.

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:05.723
To document it.

00:37:07.183 --> 00:37:08.768
To figure out what's going on.

00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:14.357
Lots of fun here.

00:37:15.107 --> 00:37:16.734
There are no laws,

00:37:16.817 --> 00:37:19.362
so we can loot and kill as we please.

00:37:19.445 --> 00:37:21.155
When I play the games,

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.949
it's like, "I don't fuckin' care!"

00:37:23.032 --> 00:37:24.450
Total freedom. Oh yeah!

00:37:25.701 --> 00:37:27.036
It feels pretty great.

00:37:29.622 --> 00:37:30.539
I hate it here.

00:37:31.123 --> 00:37:33.626
That's why I'm smoking weed…

00:37:33.709 --> 00:37:36.963
…and just flipping out.

00:37:42.718 --> 00:37:45.596
It's been 26 days
since everyone disappeared.

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.567
Hey, what are you doing?

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.696
Ann?

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:12.331
Excuse me, miss.
Is there something wrong?

00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:17.128
There are a lot more fish now.

00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:19.380
The plants
are starting to cover everything.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.008
It's like the further
we get from the city,

00:38:22.091 --> 00:38:24.218
the more that nature is growing rampant.

00:38:24.927 --> 00:38:26.971
Is that because
all the humans are gone?

00:38:27.054 --> 00:38:29.140
Well, sure, that's definitely part of it.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.101
But the plants have been growing
way too quickly.

00:38:33.686 --> 00:38:36.439
The people that are here
all came at different times.

00:38:36.522 --> 00:38:39.567
Certain things are rotting
more quickly than others.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.944
Time doesn't seem
to work the same way here.

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:46.657
Where are you going?

00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:51.203
I'm going to try to get out of Tokyo.

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.040
I wanna know what's behind all this.

00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:04.133
It's been 33 days
since everyone disappeared.

00:39:05.092 --> 00:39:07.053
I got a tip from a man I ran into.

00:39:08.387 --> 00:39:11.265
Apparently, there's a whole community
outside of Setagaya.

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:12.892
I'm headed there right now.

00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:30.951
Hi. I came here
because I heard a rumor

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:33.954
about someone who has a memory
about what happened to us.

00:39:34.663 --> 00:39:36.290
Could you take me to them?

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.376
Sure, it's just over here.

00:39:43.089 --> 00:39:45.174
Do you know
what it is they remember?

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:49.387
Do you remember the day
you arrived in this world, huh?

00:39:50.137 --> 00:39:51.555
Yeah. I think so.

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:54.892
Did you see something in the sky?

00:39:55.643 --> 00:39:58.062
- The fireworks?
- Fireworks?

00:39:59.688 --> 00:40:02.608
Yes, I remember. I saw them.

00:40:05.444 --> 00:40:06.821
Yeah, I saw them too.

00:40:08.781 --> 00:40:10.533
This way. Come on.

00:40:22.878 --> 00:40:26.340
This woman has a pretty crazy story
about them. Come on.

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:29.009
She's there. Over there.

00:40:31.512 --> 00:40:34.598
This guy wants to hear
about the fireworks. Can you tell him?

00:40:36.642 --> 00:40:37.685
Huh?

00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:39.437
Oh.

00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:41.772
The fireworks.

00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:49.822
I have a story about them.
Would you like to hear it?

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:51.782
Yes.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.996
I must be the only one who remembers.

00:40:58.581 --> 00:40:59.623
Oh?

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:04.170
When I was a little girl,

00:41:05.588 --> 00:41:07.423
I had a brain operation,

00:41:07.506 --> 00:41:10.092
so they drilled a hole, a little one,

00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:11.886
right here into my skull.

00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:15.347
Maybe that's the reason.

00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:19.768
I'm the only person

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:23.355
who seems to remember
everything about that day.

00:41:25.858 --> 00:41:27.276
When…

00:41:28.027 --> 00:41:29.111
those…

00:41:29.612 --> 00:41:31.697
fireworks flew up into the sky…

00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:35.451
I saw them.

00:41:36.243 --> 00:41:37.369
They flashed,

00:41:38.245 --> 00:41:39.747
and they looked real.

00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:42.374
But…

00:41:43.709 --> 00:41:44.752
but…

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.047
they weren't actually--

00:41:55.095 --> 00:41:57.890
It's the King of Spades!

00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:33.092
This documentary…

00:42:35.177 --> 00:42:37.763
is the only proof that I ever existed.

00:42:39.807 --> 00:42:42.851
I'll do whatever I can to keep it safe
until it's found.

00:43:15.175 --> 00:43:16.468
What's that sound?

00:43:30.482 --> 00:43:32.651
Arisu, this way!

00:43:37.156 --> 00:43:39.366
Watch out! That way!

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.097
Usagi!

00:44:14.026 --> 00:44:14.985
Hey!

00:45:27.641 --> 00:45:28.684
Usagi?

00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:34.398
Who's there?

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:03.302
Are you a citizen?

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:05.721
Huh?

00:46:07.473 --> 00:46:08.849
I guess you're not.

00:46:13.979 --> 00:46:15.355
Why did you attack me?

00:46:16.774 --> 00:46:19.234
You woulda gotten killed
if you'd kept running like that.

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:23.864
I told him to leave you behind.
We don't need dead weight.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.368
But guess what?
He wanted to carry you all the way here.

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:30.913
Who did?

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.173
You'd better thank him, Arisu.

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:44.718
How do you know my name?

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:46.595
That's what he called you.

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:53.644
Oh, watch out.

00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:58.273
He's in a pretty foul mood
since you messed up our plan.

00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:44.570
Aguni?

00:47:47.489 --> 00:47:48.699
Hey, newbie.
