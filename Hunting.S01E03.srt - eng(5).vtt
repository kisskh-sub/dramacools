What car?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
The SUV whose license plate is 95998.

Fine.

Those goods must've been in the car.

Otherwise, why would you have
chased after it?

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.070
You were in the middle of a transaction,

when someone intercepted the goods, right?

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.200
Don't try to intimidate me.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.170

On what grounds did you arrest me?

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:11.920
Illegal possession of controlled knives

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.740

were reason enough to arrest you!

that Zhi'an had injured him,

in Xin Chuanyong's notebook.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.970

Dilly Dally 0.1.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.590
Chaiju refers to

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.720
an old wizard in the 709 World.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.270
CT Troublemaker is also a character

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.440
in a dungeon of the 709 World.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.070
It's a fire dragon,

with an ugly appearance of a fish,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.880
plus a pair of shrimp claws.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.510
Dilly Dally is a voluptuous girl.

I got it!

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.240
They're using game characters

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.440
to represent themselves.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:04.970
Exactly.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:06.920
Let's say Xin Chuanyong

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.030
uses the characters from the 709 World

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.440
to refer to real people.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.520
For example,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.350
the old wizard may be Mou Haidong.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.240
Then, "Chaiju 200" is probably

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.390
equal to saying

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.440
the old wizard Mou Haidong

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.510
has 100 kg of drugs in total.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.840
It all matches the previous information.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.130
Zhi'an's deduction

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.110
makes sense.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.450
I think

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.440
the game jargon written in the notes

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.240
is all related to drug trafficking.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.750
"Dilly Dally 0.1"

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.830
probably means

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.440
he has sold 0.1 kg of drugs

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.350
to a woman.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.350
Right.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.640
That's a good guess.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.590
However,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.790
it's all a theory.

We still need solid evidence,

already turned you in?

Before the cops get hold of the goods,

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.550
he'll keep his mouth shut.

think about the goods he had.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.070
They're enough to get him a sentence.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.130
God knows if he can make it out of jail.

we can't get the goods back anyway.
