WEBVTT

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.210
Come in.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.140
(Episode 75)

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.820
Let go! Let go of me, you punks!
Do you have any idea who I am?!

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.650
What do you think you're doing?

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.120
Do you think I'm going to let you
get away with this?

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.020
There's nothing wrong with me!

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.690
I said I'm perfectly fine!

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.430
You think I have dementia, don't you?

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.000
I was faking it on purpose to see
how you'd react. Understand?

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.600
- I knew you'd be this disrespectful!
- What matters is,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.510
there's no one here on your side, Father.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.240
And I don't care whether
you have dementia or not,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.310
- and I won't be changing my mind.
- What?

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.050
So you're really going
to throw me in a nursing home?

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.750
Well, you should have
treated me better then.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.220
What have I ever denied you?

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.690
What did I ever do to you?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.660
You can think about that
in the nursing home.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.660
Get him out of here. Now.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.090
Let go of me!

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.530
You little brat!

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.230
You brat, I'll...

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.480
What did you find out?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.550
Tae Joo looked into it.
The columbarium is safe.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.420
There was no fire.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.680
Really?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.820
So that means someone deliberately
fed me false information.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.020
Who do you think?

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.460
Someone who knows you best.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.630
Someone who knows what it takes
to make you act.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.860
It's Kim Sun Jae.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.870
Something must be going down
at Chairman Min's house right now.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.410
Looks like Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae
decided today was the day.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.040
Tae Kyung is on his way there too,
so you'd better hurry.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.780
Got it.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.410
Let go of me.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.420
You punks! Do you have any idea who I am?

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.450
I said, let go!

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.960
Let him go.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.460
Who ordered you to do this?

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.130
What are you doing here, Director Moon?

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.960
How did you know to come here?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.860
Does that matter right now?

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.700
This illegal act that's taking place.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.470
Did you order this?

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.140
I'm asking you. Did you order this?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.140
Who do you think you're shouting at?
So what if she ordered it?

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.550
How can you say that to this crime
in broad daylight?

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.850
As a lawyer, you of all people
should know.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.280
This is a felony. It's called kidnapping.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.790
Stay out of this.
The Chairman has dementia,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.060
and we're just trying to get him
into a specialized facility.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.060
Dementia? Who?
I keep telling you I'm fine!

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.830
That's what dementia patients always say.
That there's nothing wrong with them.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.630
You bastard!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.300
You need his wife's permission
since she's his legal guardian.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.940
I am his daughter.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.770
Even so, you need
his wife's permission first.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.040
Seriously, what is your problem?

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.170
So I'm supposed to just leave a man
with dementia at home?

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.840
He was all by himself
in an empty house today.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.210
If something happens to him,
are you going to take responsibility?

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.780
You didn't engineer this by making sure
he was home alone, did you?

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.820
An involuntary commitment like this...

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.190
I'm about to call the police.
Let's see how this plays out.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.730
I said I'm giving my consent!
As his daughter!

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.360
We even have his doctor's report.
Who are you to butt in?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.630
We'll sort out the legal issues later.
Get him in the car before it starts.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.970
- We need to get him admitted immediately.
- You brat...

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.340
Didn't you hear what I said?

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.370
- I said get him in the car now!
- You brat!

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.740
- Where are you going!
- Let him go!

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.040
- Get out of the way!
- Move, I said!

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.680
- You punks!
- Let go! I said, let go!

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.110
- You bastards!
- I said, take your hands off him!

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.020
- Let go, you scum!
- Move!

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.120
- You won't let go?
- No, you can't!

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.280
Take your hands off him!

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.100
Who do you think you're taking
without my permission as his guardian?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.870
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.340
Do you want to find out what happens
if you don't stop right now?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.140
I'll have every single one of you
in court.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.510
Kidnapping a dementia patient,
blackmail, violence, and confinement...

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.180
I'll charge you with everything I can.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.910
And I'll make sure
you get the maximum sentence.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.850
Mark my words.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.480
You think I'm bluffing?

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.130
You call yourself his daughter after this?

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.670
Where are you trying to send
your sick father?

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.240
You're going to lock him up until he dies?

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.570
Says who?

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.280
As of today,
you're no daughter of his, not even human.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.240
What you did today?

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.250
The Chairman might forgive you,
but I never will.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.490
Chairman, let's go inside.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.570
This way.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.140
You must have been so scared.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.050
Would you like something
to calm your nerves?

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.090
I can't believe your daughter did this.
How could she betray you like that?

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.590
Of all people.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.960
Chairman, maybe it's a blessing
you can't comprehend all this.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.630
To be betrayed like this
by the child you trusted most.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.060
How could you possibly endure it
if you were in your right mind?

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.000
I just stepped out for a minute
on an urgent matter...

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.200
and who could have known
all this would happen?

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.370
It's all my fault.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.970
It's not your fault.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.410
Stop crying.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.350
Chairman?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.290
I don't have dementia.
I'm perfectly lucid.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.650
I was faking it for a reason.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.390
Are you serious? Are you really okay?

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.400
- So you're really lucid?
- Yes, I told you I am.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.430
Then what could possibly be the reason?
I really thought you had dementia.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.340
You scared me half to death!

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.740
I'm sorry.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.080
If I'd known you'd worry this much,
I wouldn't have done it.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.610
That's enough now.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.280
You're just making me feel more guilty.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.420
I didn't think
things would get this out of hand.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.060
Why aren't you answering me?

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.890
I asked you how you got here.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.460
Did Lucia call you or something?

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.270
That's what I'd like to know.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.800
It seems the two of you
are still secretly in touch.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.840
There's a name for that.
It's called an affair.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.110
I came to see the Chairman
about a separate matter.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.380
What business could you possibly have
with a man who's lost his mind?

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.910
There's no need to listen to him.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.820
You think I don't know you're in touch,
cooking up some scheme?

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.520
I was going to keep my mouth shut,
but you're forcing my hand.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.660
You asked why I'm here, right?

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.560
I came to brief the Chairman
on the secret ledger.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.060
Secret ledger?

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.900
- And what's that supposed to be?
- What is he talking about?

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.600
Leave. Now.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.110
We don't need you
getting involved in this.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.540
Didn't you hear me?
I said get out of here!

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:22.850
All right, if you say so.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.180
I can always see the Chairman
another time.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.490
What was that about a secret ledger?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.390
I have no idea.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.000
He's just talking nonsense.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.730
Don't pay him any mind.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.800
Right now, what's more important is
what we're going to do about the Chairman.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.140
Let's go to the company first.
No, wait, let's stop by the hospital.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.270
There's something I need to confirm
with Dr. Kim.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.310
My father is claiming
he doesn't have dementia.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.180
What's going on?

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.050
He seemed a little off to me.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.990
It was like he was lucid for a moment.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.750
You were right.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.220
The Chairman doesn't have dementia.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:06.890
What did you just say?

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.360
Then why in the world?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.100
What was that report you gave me?

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.070
That was on the Chairman's orders.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.900
He asked to be diagnosed...

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.470
with dementia,

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.440
so I simply obliged.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.040
And you just played along
because the Chairman asked you to?

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.680
And you call yourself a doctor?
How could you be so thoughtless?

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.550
Didn't you stop to think about
how worried his children would be?

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.280
Funny you should say that.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.580
I wasn't sure...

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.390
how worried his kids would be.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.420
And I'm sure the Chairman felt the same.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.260
That's why he pulled a stunt like this.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.690
I'm not letting this go.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.960
I'm filing a lawsuit.
You're not getting away with this!

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.630
Instead of taking your anger out on me,

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.670
you should reflect on why you've gotten...

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.070
on your father's bad side.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.590
Please, calm down.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.260
That conniving old man.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.960
Does he have nothing better to do
than test his own kids?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.200
He completely played me, didn't he?

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.140
I fell for the Chairman's act,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.270
didn't I?

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.220
(Mingang Distribution)

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.130
Please calm down.
At this point, what's done is done.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.800
How can I possibly calm down?
I completely showed him my hand.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.630
I'm in the same boat.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.200
I feel completely exposed
in front of him right now.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.470
I can't forgive him for orchestrating
this whole thing on purpose.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.510
What on earth was he trying to test?
Who was he trying to sound out?

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.610
Where have you been?

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.150
The holiday home in Yangpyeong.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.120
I didn't want to go,
but Manager Gong insisted.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.930
The fact that you dragged her there
when she didn't want to go...

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.790
means you must have had a reason.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.830
Then again, it's not like
you can say no to Kyung Chae.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.740
You were home?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.310
No. I was out and just got back myself.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.580
And where have you two been?

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.910
We got some free concert tickets.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.180
We already had dinner,
so don't worry about us.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.050
- Okay.
- Must have been a nice place.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.350
A globally acclaimed restaurant.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.520
Someone pulled strings and got us a table
at a place that's impossible to get into.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.090
Don't tell me Kim Sun Jae arranged
that concert and restaurant?

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.460
How did you know?

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.080
They're just unbelievable.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.350
They all know you're sick in bed,
yet they're all out and about.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.250
What can you expect
from a bunch like that?

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.490
It's not like I'm really sick,
so don't be upset.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.460
But why would you do something like that?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.830
To say it was dementia, of all things.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.260
You have no idea how scared I was.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.770
Why? Were you afraid
I'd be a burden on you for life?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
No.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.510
I was afraid I was going to lose you.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.680
I don't care if you're a burden.
I just want you to stay with me always.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.240
I was afraid that might not happen.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.110
I had no idea.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.320
There's something
I have to confess to you.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.390
Do you know why I staged this whole thing?

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.160
I was afraid I'd end up like Chairman Mo
of Inam Construction.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.830
If dementia suddenly made me unable
to even control my own bowels,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.330
would you believe I had to act pretend
I had dementia...

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.200
because of my greedy kids
who'd jump at the chance to take over?

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.670
I'm telling you,
even a man like me got scared.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.240
Of course,
it's not like I trusted you, either.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.310
Chairman.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.180
I knew I'd failed as a father,
but I had no idea it was this bad.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.950
I used to worry
they'd tear each other apart,

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.690
but who knew
they'd try to come after me, too?

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.690
You should have at least told me.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.960
What can I say? It's just the way I am.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.130
But not anymore.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.130
Now that I've seen
how loyal you truly are,

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.700
from now on, if you say
the sky is square, it's square to me.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.170
If you say it,

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.370
I'd believe that black is white.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.880
Everything was quiet today, right?

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.520
Yes, it was.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.820
Hey, where've you been on your day off?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.450
I had plans to meet up with someone.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.620
Manager Gong, why did you and Se Ri...

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.360
suddenly go to the villa in Yangpyeong?

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.130
Oh, we just wanted to get some fresh air.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.060
Wait a minute!

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.170
Then that means no one was home?

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.570
What about her?

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.970
Is she home?

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.480
I think she just got back
from going out, too.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.840
What did you just say?

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:32.780
What is going on?

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.090
You left the house unattended, didn't you?

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.460
- Wait a second.
- Are you out of your mind?

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.420
After I specifically warned you!

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.490
And my father?

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.610
Oh, I thought...

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.110
Kyung Chae had driven everyone out
and done something to Dad in the meantime.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.290
My sister is just itching to throw you
in a nursing home, you know?

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.020
Believe me, I'd love to do the same thing,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.230
but then that fox would steal the company,
so I'm holding myself back.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:22.200
You probably can't understand me,
but I have plenty of gripes with you too!

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.900
If you've got such a grudge,

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.870
why don't you two just send me to a home?

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.960
You all thought you had it made
when I got dementia, didn't you?

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.300
You were all practically giddy.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.500
You saw your chance and had no problem
saying what was really on your minds.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.200
Thanks to this, I know for sure
what you all really think of me.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.140
Every last one of you
is a rotten piece of filth.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.510
You're nothing but vipers
disguised as my children.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.810
You used my money and bled me dry,
then tried to discard me...

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.280
when you thought I was useless.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.980
You filthy mongrels.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:13.620
This can't be happening!

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.990
Father, you don't have dementia?

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.760
What? Are you disappointed
your old man is perfectly fine?

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.060
Are you disappointed I'm not a senile man
who can't even control his own bladder?

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.180
What's gotten into him?
I thought he had dementia.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.650
- He says he doesn't.
- Well, that's a relief, I guess...

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.880
Just think about it for a second! Think!

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.990
Then again, I guess you can't think.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:53.520
Anyway, with you ending up like this,
I'd say you got off easy.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.930
You should have been a better person.
And maybe taken care of me.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.170
What am I going to do now?

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.530
What's wrong?

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.140
Did you say something
you shouldn't have to Father?

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.440
You got flustered and said something awful
to him, didn't you?

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.680
See?
You should've been more careful, like me.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.050
Seriously...

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.700
Oh, my God! What am I going to do?

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.040
That's exactly what I can't
forgive you for.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.950
That you're a calculating man
who would even exploit his own child.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.790
I know you were blinded by her, but still!

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.530
I, Manager Gong...

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.160
I mean, is this what I, Gong Mae Ja,

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.800
get after all these years
I've served this family?

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.230
Chairman.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.440
You'll be punished for acting this way.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.370
I must've been out of my mind.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.810
Why can't I keep my big mouth shut?

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.680
What am I going to do?

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.880
There's no way...

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.420
the Chairman will let this slide.
What should we do?

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.320
I wouldn't let it slide either
if I were him.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.760
Now he knows what his kids
really think of him.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.030
You know how he is.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.730
I can't believe things ended up like this.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.170
This is all Lucia's fault.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.670
If only Lucia hadn't gotten in the way.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.670
For now,
let's see the Chairman's reaction.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.570
And as for the two of us,

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.440
we should probably lay low for a while.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.990
Sir. I'm here.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.990
- Welcome.
- Come on in.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.130
He tells me
you're working at our in-laws' company?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.860
- I'm sorry, I should've told you sooner.
- What's to be sorry about?

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.470
That makes sense.
A handsome, accomplished man like you...

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.240
belongs at a major company.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.340
Hang on a second.
I'll go get you some tea.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.940
At work, do you hear any news
about Chairman Min?

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.050
I know it's bad news, so I hate to ask,
but this uncertainty is killing me.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.990
I don't think you need to worry too much.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.160
He'll be back to his old self again
before you know it.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.160
What kind of crazy talk is that?

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.990
How does someone with dementia
just get better?

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.730
Because I don't think
he actually has dementia.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.200
- It's just a hunch.
- What are you talking about?

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:56.070
I'll go to Mingang Distribution myself.
I might even get to see Lucia there.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.610
I've been wondering
how she's doing anyway.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.280
You should.
And Lucia was asking for you, by the way.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.580
What? Lucia asked about me?

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.550
When? Where? How?
What was her tone? Longing? Desperate?

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.960
How am I supposed to interpret that?
Come on, give me some advice!

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.130
What am I going to do?

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.030
Okay, I understand.
How is this your fault?

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.930
You were just following my orders.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.370
I'll call you later.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.640
- Was that Dr. Kim?
- Yes. He said Kyung Chae visited him.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.440
So she knows everything now?

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.280
Looks that way.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.650
I can't let you go in alone.
I'm just too worried.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.790
Who knows what Kyung Chae will do there?
I'm going back to work.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.360
I don't care about the title.
As long as I can be by your side.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.730
I need to see for myself that you're safe.
I can't stay home worrying. It's torture.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.600
Are you that worried about me?

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.170
Do you even need to ask?

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.900
Then go back to work if you want.
But don't do it just for me.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:03.370
- Only come back when you're ready to.
- But I do want to work again.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.010
Start immediately. What's stopping you?
Mingang is my company.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.080
That's a call I'm allowed to make.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.150
Dad!

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.190
Dad, are you all right now?

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.160
Can't you see for yourself?
I'm fine, so stop worrying.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.860
Where is everyone? Why aren't they here?

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.270
I said get out of here!

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.910
Come on. I'm serious,
he's going to kill me!

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.840
Then go out there and face him! Hurry!
What other choice is there?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.040
No, I can't...

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.450
What are you all doing,
hiding like rats in a hole?

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.220
Did you commit a crime or something?

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.490
Please, don't be like this.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.360
They probably didn't get a wink of sleep
last night.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.930
Please, just this once,
let it go for my sake.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.670
I'm only going this easy on you
because of your stepmother.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.700
You should be on your knees thanking her.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.240
- And Kyung Chae?
- She didn't come home last night.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.240
After what she pulled on her own father,

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.310
if she could come back and sleep well,
she wouldn't be human.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.220
Calm down and let's get you to work.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.230
(Mingang Distribution)

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.700
You're in early.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.200
Are you feeling all right, sir?

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.110
Come have a cup of tea in my office.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.180
What was that about at my house yesterday?

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.320
Vice Director Min told me your condition
and came because I was concerned.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.860
Of course, I was hesitant to interfere
in a private family matter.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.260
In any case, I apologize.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.930
There's nothing to apologize for.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.300
I'm embarrassed you had to see
that side of my family,

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.300
but now I know you're on my side,
and that's what matters.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.470
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean, sir.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.910
I think I may have misjudged you.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.410
I thought you must resent me.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.710
But I never expected you
to come to my aid.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.580
I would have rushed to help anyone
in the same situation.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.490
It's not because you're the Chairman.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.660
I'd do it even for my worst enemy.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.860
Is that another lesson from your father?

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.490
Yes, it is.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.130
It sounds like I owe my life
to your father, then.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.470
And you're the one who did the unspeakable
to a father like that.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.320
Hey, Moon Tae Kyung.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.290
If you mention the secret ledger
to anyone,

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.460
you and Lucia are finished. Got it?

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.360
You think I'll go down alone?

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.300
No. Even if I go to hell,

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.170
I'm dragging you with me.
I refuse to go alone.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.010
At least he knows he's going to hell.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.790
You nearly gave me a heart attack!

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.190
You startled me.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.900
If the proposal that is due today,
submit it to the Chairman's Office now.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.200
Are you crazy?

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.430
You want me to walk right
into the lion's den?

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.740
I don't have a death wish.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.770
I'm not going near the Chairman's Office,
so get that through your head.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.440
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:03.650
Unless you want that office as my grave,
don't send me in there. Seriously!

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.950
I'm not going. I can't go.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.860
Where did you stay last night?

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.160
At the company residence.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.860
I feel like I walked right into a trap
set by the Chairman.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.570
I've never felt so powerless.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:26.000
I'm sure he intended for someone else
to get caught in that trap.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.610
That trap was definitely
not meant for you.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.680
It doesn't matter who it was for.
I'm the one who got caught.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.310
Even if the Chairman picks someone else
as his successor, I can't say a word.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.180
Because I've given him the perfect excuse.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:40.920
So, what's your plan now?

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.820
I don't know.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.320
For now, all I can do is wait
for the Chairman's decision.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.390
So now Min Kyung Chae just has to wait
to face the music.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.670
Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae won't be
pulling a stunt like this ever again.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:01.040
I knew he was a terrible person,
but now I see he's worse than an animal.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.310
How could he lie about a fire
at the columbarium...

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.780
where your daughter rests
just to pull off his scheme?

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.910
They thought if they got Chairman Min
in a nursing home,

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.950
the world would be theirs for the taking.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.150
They'd stop at nothing.
Not when what they want is so close.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.490
Now that they're about to lose it all,
I bet they're an absolute wreck.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.490
Right. When do you think
you'll be back at the company?

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.200
- Soon.
- That's great.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.770
I wonder what position
Min Doo Sik will offer you.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.410
I hope it's a position where you can
tighten the leash on Min Kyung Chae.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.950
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.620
I can't let you go in alone.
I'm just too worried.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.520
Who knows what Kyung Chae will do there?

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:53.090
I'm going back to work.
I don't care about the title.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.660
As long as I can be by your side.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.600
She's so devoted to me.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.870
I can't just give a person like that
some insignificant position.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:08.040
Tell CEO Min to come to my office.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.340
- I was wrong, Father.
- What exactly were you wrong about?

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.850
That you tried to ship your father
with dementia off to a nursing home?

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.090
Or that you acted like
you owned Mingang Distribution?

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.090
I said, tell me. What did you do wrong?

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.460
I have no excuse.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:32.860
I promise you.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.570
It will never happen again.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.030
In return,

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.470
I'll dedicate myself to my role
as CEO and boost sales.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.770
I'll make up for my mistakes, Father,
by proving my worth as CEO.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.210
No, there's no need for that!

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.350
You won't get the chance
to make up for anything as CEO.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.980
What does that mean...

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:55.720
You're a failure as a daughter,
and you're a failure as a CEO.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.920
Resign as CEO.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:04.230
Step down and start over from the bottom.
That's your punishment.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.160
An entry-level position?

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.100
You're joking, right?

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.900
How could you do this
without even discussing it with me?

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:16.070
When did you ask about the nursing home?
I won't repeat myself!

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.840
Even so, this is going too far.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:22.880
Who else could possibly take my place?
Did you forget your philosophy, Father?

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.620
That the executive team
must be members of the Min family.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.790
You're not seriously considering
putting Soo Jung in my position, are you?

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:31.890
It can't be Ji Seop.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.190
So who on earth
could possibly take my place?

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:38.430
Who says there's no one?
There is a perfect candidate.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.460
A perfect candidate? Who?

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.670
Don't tell me...

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.540
Is it Lucia?

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.200
That's right. Lucia!

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.140
I'm putting her in your seat.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.360
(The Woman Who Swallowed The Sun)

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.210
The old man's gone senile.
There's no other explanation.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.240
So Father is kicking Kyung Chae out
to put that woman in charge?

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.080
So, what will it be? Will you resign?

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.280
Handing the CEO to that woman?
Does that make any sense?

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.250
And you call yourselves my children?
You live in my house, stuffing your faces,

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.090
and live off my company, yet you defy me?
I'm done with all of you!

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.190
Because I'm signing this house
over to her.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.560
