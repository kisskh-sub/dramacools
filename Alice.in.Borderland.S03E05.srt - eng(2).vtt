00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.143
Huh?

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.131
It's a monitor.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:48.793
This is CGI, right?

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:50.336
"CGI"?

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:52.088
Really?

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.349
-Missed you.
-Same here.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.684
-I picked this up.
-Thanks.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.562
I'm so hungry.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.285
Usagi?

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:49.038
Arisu.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.136
At last,

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:05.763
I found you.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.475
I'm sorry.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:19.694
Let's go home.

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:24.365
Yeah.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.909
Ouch.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:28.911
Sorry.

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:10.870
You…

00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:13.081
-Hey!
-Ryuji!

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:16.501
Why are you with Usagi?
She's dead because of you!

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:17.877
You son of a bitch!

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.170
Stop, Arisu!

00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:20.213
-Arisu!
-Ryuji?

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:22.215
Ryuji, are you all right?

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.509
Okay, there you go.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:30.515
-He's been fighting alongside me.
-Usagi…

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.810
I made it this far, thanks to him.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.063
-Still--
-He saved my life.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.358
I'm with you now, thanks to him.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.162
Entry is now closed.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.250
There are ten players.

00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:00.044
"Ten players"?

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.131
There are only nine here.

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.133
I don't get it.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:07.760
A child.

00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:09.262
What?

00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:13.266
There's a child.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.358
You're pregnant, Usagi.

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:28.614
We're having a baby?

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.034
Yes, a baby.

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:37.540
I get it.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.918
The baby in her belly makes it ten.

00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:43.212
Congrats!

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:47.049
But a child in this situation is…

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.560
The game will now commence.

00:07:58.352 --> 00:07:59.604
It's starting.

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:03.149
Please put on the wristbands and collars.

00:08:18.122 --> 00:08:20.708
The game is Future Sugoroku.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.132
Here are the rules.

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:59.932
There are a total of 25 rooms
arranged in five rows and five columns.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:05.521
Roll the dice on the platform
in the center of each room.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.859
The numbers you roll determine
how many people can advance to each room.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:16.073
Repeat this as you try to reach
the exit room within 15 turns.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:18.409
EXIT

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:24.540
However, if there are more people
than the numbers rolled,

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.960
the excess individuals
cannot leave the room.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.464
The doors will be locked,
forcing them to stay.

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:33.507
FORCED STAY

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:38.137
To unlock the room,
use the transceiver on the wristband

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.142
to coordinate and position players
on opposite sides of the locked room.

00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:46.520
UNLOCKED

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:50.483
You have each been allocated 15 points.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.488
To pass through a door,

00:10:55.571 --> 00:11:01.369
one of you must use one point
by holding your wristband up to it.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.417
To return to the previous room,
you must stay where you are for one turn.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.504
The door will only be unlocked after that.

00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:16.842
Whether you choose to
or are forced to stay,

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:20.054
one point will be used each turn.

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:23.683
It's game over if you run out of points.

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:34.944
The walls through which you can proceed
will display images of your future.

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:37.947
The one that you choose

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:43.119
is the future
that will come to pass once you exit.

00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:49.125
"The future that will come to pass."

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:56.632
THE FUTURE THAT WILL COME TO PASS

00:11:57.508 --> 00:12:00.219
Proceed according to the dice rolls

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:04.598
and choose your future
as you search for the exit.

00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:09.145
So we need to work together
to find the exit?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.985
May I ask your names?

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:23.909
I'm Sohta, and this is my sister--

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:24.994
I'm Yuna.

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:26.912
I'm Arisu.

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:34.628
This is Sachiko, Rei, Tetsu, and Nobu.

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:41.635
Now roll the dice,
and then choose which room to enter.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.138
You have three minutes.

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:04.033
So the dice colors
correspond to the doors.

00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:06.076
Okay!

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.662
Dice are my specialty.

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:11.248
Because you're a gambling addict?

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.419
First turn. Begin.

00:13:21.008 --> 00:13:22.092
Okay.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:55.084
Is this really the future?

00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:59.463
Is this for real?

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:10.641
-Here it comes!
-You won again?

00:14:10.724 --> 00:14:13.644
Bonus mode!

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:18.107
We give thanks for this meal.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.483
What?

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:20.860
Really?

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:29.118
The future is different on each wall.

00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:31.161
Goddamn machine!

00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:36.125
Shit!

00:14:39.336 --> 00:14:42.673
Your future changes depending on the door?

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:50.556
Please.

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:55.644
Matsuyama, it's time
to study something else.

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:59.064
Please, just a glance.
Please read it, Professor.

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:01.317
It'll all be for nothing if I quit now.

00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:12.328
The Academy isn't going to
waste their time reading this nonsense.

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:15.539
Please read it, at least.

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:19.752
You should submit that
to occult magazines.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.730
Okay, smile.

00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:40.814
Smile.

00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:43.817
Nice day, huh?

00:15:44.401 --> 00:15:46.111
Yeah, feels great.

00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:49.406
If I have my choice of futures,

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:51.825
I'll pick the blue door.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.328
Me too.

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:58.832
But only seven people
can go through the blue door.

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:01.877
One person for the yellow door?

00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:06.507
-All right!
-Nice shot, Hida!

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.925
Nice!

00:16:08.842 --> 00:16:10.719
I prefer yellow.

00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:17.977
No, the key to this game is minimizing
point loss as we make our way through.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.855
So we should move together
whenever possible.

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:29.196
We should split into two groups
of the largest numbers, seven and five.

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:34.702
Sohta and Yuna,
would you go to room D3 with Rei?

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:37.705
You three…

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.210
will go to the room to the east, D3.

00:16:43.877 --> 00:16:46.296
We'll go to the room to the north, C2.

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:50.843
Based on the diagram,
we can quickly regroup in D2.

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:52.886
D3.

00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:56.682
-Do it.
-Yuna.

00:16:56.765 --> 00:16:59.852
Ken? I didn't notice you were here!

00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:00.936
This is my brother.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.813
Ken is a college classmate…

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:03.939
Understood.

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:07.151
We're fine with the red door.

00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:10.654
One minute remaining.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.950
-Then, it's decided.
-Let's go.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.369
Why do you trust him?

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:22.624
You're free to choose another door.

00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:40.809
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:45.939
All right, let's go.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.371
We'll regroup later.

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:02.664
Okay.

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:18.764
I'm Rei Morikage.

00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:22.142
I've loved anime since I was a kid.

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.769
I draw a lot.

00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:26.647
How quickly do you draw?

00:18:27.147 --> 00:18:31.401
It currently takes me three days
to complete one drawing…

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:38.408
C2 is a minus-one-point room.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:43.330
-Please select whose points to use.
-Why is it deducting a point?

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:47.126
Some rooms probably have a point penalty.

00:18:47.751 --> 00:18:51.588
We won't know till we enter,
which makes it tricky.

00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:56.969
We just used Arisu's points,
so let's use mine.

00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:05.477
Second turn. Begin.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:19.032
Now roll the dice,
and then choose which room to enter.

00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:23.370
We can't return to the last room
without waiting a turn.

00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:26.665
That leaves three rooms,
which explains the three dice.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:28.917
All right!

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.177
Three, one, five?

00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:54.026
If this really is the future,

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.529
I'd choose the blue door in this room too.

00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:59.281
MOVIE TICKET
EVERYBODY LOVES FAMILY!

00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:02.993
-We should do this now and then.
-I wanted to see this.

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:08.498
CLASS 1 ARCHITECT
DESIGN DRAWING EXAM

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:11.460
What?

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.755
You're gonna try to be an architect?

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:18.592
I am?

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.556
What would you do
if a student were bullied in your class?

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.391
Mr. Hida, what do you think?

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:30.270
-I wouldn't just stop it.
-The future that will come to pass.

00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:31.939
I'd first listen to both…

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:34.191
I don't wanna choose the red door.

00:20:42.115 --> 00:20:45.702
Hida, there's an interesting seminar.
Wanna go?

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.246
SKILL DEVELOPMENT SEMINAR

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:48.997
I don't have time.

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:52.292
Think of it as an investment
in your future self.

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:54.753
At least go hear what they have to say.

00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:58.340
Please sign your name here.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.884
Okay, thank you.

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:03.178
-Please take a seat.
-All right.

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:07.182
D2 is beyond the red door.
That's where we plan to regroup.

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:13.063
I'll go through the red door to the east
and meet up with Rei and the others.

00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:14.898
I'll go too.

00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:21.446
Can I ask the rest of you
to go through the blue door to room C1?

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.450
You did it, Matsuyama.
It's the research funding you wanted.

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:28.245
-Is this for real?
-Yes, congratulations.

00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:30.163
Thank you very much.

00:21:32.874 --> 00:21:34.084
Let's meet up later.

00:21:41.174 --> 00:21:42.175
All right.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.594
Let's go.

00:21:52.227 --> 00:21:54.771
TO: YUZUHA ARISU

00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:57.858
THANK YOU FOR THE OTHER DAY
CAN WE MEET?

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:05.157
This is getting weird.

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:10.370
Is this game peeking into our minds?

00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:21.923
All twos.

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:37.856
I'll head north to D2.

00:22:38.398 --> 00:22:43.528
I wish the three of us could go together,
but we have to split into two groups.

00:22:44.946 --> 00:22:45.947
Got it.

00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:50.786
We'll go east to E3.

00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:52.120
Okay.

00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:54.581
JOB OFFER CONFIRMATION

00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:57.042
No way!

00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:03.465
This is delicious!

00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:05.258
Hey, are you listening to me?

00:23:11.098 --> 00:23:14.684
Rei, let's meet up in room D2 as planned.

00:23:15.352 --> 00:23:16.353
Roger that.

00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:29.616
-Okay.
-Thank goodness.

00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:30.534
Yeah.

00:23:31.034 --> 00:23:33.495
Third turn. Begin.

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:37.749
Huh? One and two?

00:23:49.886 --> 00:23:54.057
Usagi counts as two,
so she can only go to D1.

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:57.185
Only one can go to E2.

00:23:57.686 --> 00:24:00.730
So one of us will be forced to stay.

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:07.154
Everyone, this is Morikage.
She'll be starting today.

00:24:07.654 --> 00:24:09.948
I look forward to working with you.

00:24:10.031 --> 00:24:11.074
I'm Rei Morikage.

00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:12.993
It's nice to meet you.

00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:16.830
I guess it can't be helped.

00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:21.543
I'll stay this time.

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:22.794
What?

00:24:23.503 --> 00:24:25.088
Keep your kid safe.

00:24:25.755 --> 00:24:27.507
-But…
-Rei.

00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:30.469
I owe you one from Zombie Hunt.

00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:42.522
Meet up with Sachiko and the others.

00:24:45.108 --> 00:24:46.568
Sachiko, are you there?

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.575
Yeah, I can hear you.

00:24:54.701 --> 00:24:56.578
How many can go to D1?

00:24:58.622 --> 00:25:00.332
Four. We all can.

00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:02.834
That's great.

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:07.422
-Then please head east to D1.
-I'm sick of your nagging.

00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:09.799
-Meet with Usagi there.
-Let's not fight here.

00:25:09.883 --> 00:25:12.219
This place isn't good enough for you?

00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:15.180
-That's not what I meant.
-Did I ask you to apologize?

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:17.307
Roger that.

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:23.230
Sohta and Yuna,
could you please stay where you are?

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:28.151
Usagi and I will move this turn,
and Rei will be forced to stay.

00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:32.155
I want you to return to D3 after one turn.

00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:35.617
That will end Rei's forced stay.

00:25:36.451 --> 00:25:38.703
After that, let's meet at E3.

00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:41.289
It's best to stay together.

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:43.375
So we should stay. Understood.

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:52.842
All right, let's all go to D1.

00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:56.471
Because Arisu said
to move together whenever possible?

00:25:57.889 --> 00:26:01.685
-I mean--
-Listen, we need to find the exit.

00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:05.021
We might find it faster if we split up.

00:26:06.314 --> 00:26:07.607
Besides,

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:11.653
shouldn't we give our futures
a little more thought?

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.965
Mr. Matsuyama!

00:26:32.924 --> 00:26:34.384
Look at these numbers.

00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:38.138
I think these results are enough
to prove your hypothesis.

00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:40.473
You did it! This is amazing!

00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:46.521
You'll go out there and sell this water
for 3,000 yen per bottle.

00:26:47.188 --> 00:26:50.066
You're free to leave now if you want out.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.778
If you're serious about
changing your life, come with me.

00:26:53.862 --> 00:26:56.364
Why did you join this seminar?

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:58.700
To awaken my true potential.

00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:00.535
That's right.

00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:04.998
This time, you're going to sell this water
for 30,000 yen per bottle.

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:09.127
Do you understand why you have to sell it?

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.629
TRUE AWAKENING
LUCKY WATER

00:27:10.712 --> 00:27:13.131
-Excuse me…
-No thanks.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:15.967
No, thank you.

00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:17.260
This is impossible.

00:27:17.344 --> 00:27:19.596
-Please let me return them.
-Cut the crap!

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:22.015
It's in the contract you signed.

00:27:22.098 --> 00:27:24.309
No returns allowed!

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:27.604
-I'm sorry.
-Huh?!

00:27:27.687 --> 00:27:29.939
He's so drunk. I'm so sorry!

00:27:30.023 --> 00:27:32.275
What do you mean, you're sorry?

00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:35.654
-Why are you apologizing?
-Stop it!

00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:36.738
Please, just…

00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:38.615
REJECTION LETTER

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:44.245
You're hired.

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:45.246
Really?

00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:47.582
We look forward to working with you.

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:49.292
Thank you very much.

00:27:49.376 --> 00:27:52.003
-Thanks for coming.
-Thank you for hiring me.

00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:00.845
The exit is likely
in one of the corner rooms,

00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:03.348
as they are the furthest from the center.

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:08.395
It might be worth a shot.

00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:10.939
Yeah.

00:28:12.565 --> 00:28:15.985
So let's split into two groups
and head for the corner rooms.

00:28:16.569 --> 00:28:19.823
But I don't want to ignore
what Arisu said.

00:28:19.906 --> 00:28:23.660
So how about the two of us
go this way as a compromise?

00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:29.165
I'll meet up with Usagi,
and you'll go towards the corner room.

00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:31.751
Fine.

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:34.921
Okay, then.

00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:37.382
We'll go to B1.

00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:39.300
That okay?

00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:41.803
I guess.

00:28:57.819 --> 00:28:58.820
Let's break up.

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.406
I don't love you anymore.

00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:04.033
Did I do something wrong?

00:29:04.117 --> 00:29:05.410
Look, Sohta.

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:06.953
I'm sorry.

00:29:07.454 --> 00:29:09.622
No, wait, Ken! Don't go!

00:29:11.207 --> 00:29:12.208
Why?

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:15.962
We're going to get married.

00:29:17.046 --> 00:29:18.506
Please give us your blessing.

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:21.050
Is that right?

00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:23.386
-Yeah.
-Congratulations.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.221
-Thanks.
-Thank you very much.

00:29:51.998 --> 00:29:54.417
Wow! Look at that huge lake.

00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:56.711
No, Yuna. It's a dam.

00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:57.754
What? A dam?

00:29:57.837 --> 00:30:00.381
-It's a lake formed by a dam.
-Like a reservoir?

00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:02.550
Then she's half right!

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:04.844
See? I'm half right.

00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:06.805
Yuna, you're so excited today.

00:30:06.888 --> 00:30:10.350
Of course! It's been so long
since we went out as a family.

00:30:10.433 --> 00:30:12.268
-It's so fun!
-That's right.

00:30:29.077 --> 00:30:30.954
We did everything we could,

00:30:32.747 --> 00:30:36.042
but I'm afraid
your parents didn't make it.

00:31:50.783 --> 00:31:56.581
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

00:32:03.379 --> 00:32:04.380
Sohta,

00:32:05.298 --> 00:32:06.132
are you sure?

00:32:23.524 --> 00:32:24.984
Forced stay.

00:32:27.862 --> 00:32:29.572
You're completely useless!

00:32:34.994 --> 00:32:35.828
What?

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.583
You're completely useless!

00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:43.169
What is this?!

00:32:45.046 --> 00:32:46.381
-1 ROOM

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:48.508
Point deduction confirmed.

00:32:49.425 --> 00:32:51.761
Fourth turn. Begin.

00:32:52.887 --> 00:32:54.681
-I'll roll the dice
-Okay.

00:33:20.289 --> 00:33:22.709
Yellow to the west is a corner room.

00:33:23.459 --> 00:33:24.836
But only one of us can go.

00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:28.881
It's better not to split up now.

00:33:30.383 --> 00:33:31.634
Let's go south to B2.

00:33:32.135 --> 00:33:34.929
You did it. You got a job offer!

00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:37.598
-A job offer, Nobu? Congrats.
-Congrats.

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:38.516
Well done!

00:33:38.599 --> 00:33:39.434
Nobu!

00:33:41.602 --> 00:33:42.603
You listening?

00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:46.315
-Yeah.
-You did it. You got a job offer!

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:49.569
You got a job offer, Nobu? Congrats.

00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:52.572
Let's stay here so we can get Rei out.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.743
I'll check the corner room next door.

00:33:56.826 --> 00:33:58.369
What if it's a trap?

00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:00.079
I still have 15 points.

00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:01.164
I'll be fine.

00:34:05.251 --> 00:34:06.252
Sohta,

00:34:07.086 --> 00:34:08.838
what numbers did you roll?

00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:16.846
Sohta.

00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:20.767
Sohta? Yuna?

00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:23.770
You're currently staying at E3, right?

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.774
Can you move to D3? Please unlock Rei.

00:34:29.108 --> 00:34:30.151
Understood.

00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:32.653
Are you sure?

00:34:35.656 --> 00:34:36.491
Look.

00:34:42.997 --> 00:34:45.166
A corner room is behind the green door.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.960
The exit might be there.

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:50.296
Arisu wouldn't try to save us

00:34:50.838 --> 00:34:55.134
if it meant losing
Usagi and his unborn child.

00:34:59.138 --> 00:35:00.973
For Mom and Dad's sake,

00:35:01.808 --> 00:35:04.060
we need to head toward that future.

00:35:15.238 --> 00:35:16.280
Let's go.

00:35:17.365 --> 00:35:18.199
Okay.

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:23.788
I'll do it.

00:35:31.003 --> 00:35:33.422
Rei, are you okay?

00:35:33.506 --> 00:35:36.050
Hurry! I feel like I'm going insane!

00:35:36.926 --> 00:35:39.095
Sohta and Yuna are heading to D3.

00:35:39.178 --> 00:35:40.888
You should be unlocked soon.

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:45.143
Please!

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:05.997
-Congrats!
-Congrats!

00:36:07.373 --> 00:36:08.207
Hey!

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:10.751
Let's go.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.589
I'll use my points.

00:37:03.512 --> 00:37:06.098
He sells weird water. It's Nobu!

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:10.561
Drink up, and I'll buy a bottle. Go on!

00:37:10.645 --> 00:37:16.067
-Chug it!
-Chug it!

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.151
Go on, chug it!

00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:20.529
Next one!

00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:23.574
-Next one!
-Chug it!

00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:27.078
-Why do you have that?
-Hey!

00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:29.747
-I have it 'cause I wanna drink!
-Hey!

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.541
Drink!

00:37:32.625 --> 00:37:34.335
Chug!

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:36.462
I can't drink anymore. I give up.

00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:38.756
Got something to say?

00:37:38.839 --> 00:37:43.177
Say it after drinking!

00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.720
-Okay!
-Chug!

00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:49.600
Say it after drinking!

00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:50.559
Chug!

00:37:50.643 --> 00:37:51.978
Say it after drinking!

00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:55.690
-Disgusting!
-That's so gross!

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:56.774
I'm sorry.

00:37:56.857 --> 00:37:58.901
Seriously, drop dead!

00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:05.241
Drop dead!

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:09.620
Tetsu, I'm sorry.

00:38:10.579 --> 00:38:11.414
Hey!

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.001
Nobu!

00:38:15.918 --> 00:38:18.129
What the hell is he doing?

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:32.643
I'm all alone now.

00:38:33.394 --> 00:38:34.603
-6 ROOM
NOBUAKI HIDA: 13

00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:38.649
A1 is a minus-six-point room.

00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:39.775
Seriously?

00:38:45.197 --> 00:38:46.782
It wasn't the exit room.

00:38:47.283 --> 00:38:50.119
And it's a corner room,
so there's only one door.

00:38:51.912 --> 00:38:55.041
E5 is a minus-four-point room.

00:38:55.124 --> 00:38:55.958
What?

00:38:57.668 --> 00:38:59.503
-4 ROOM
SOHTA ITSUKI: 13, YUNA ITSUKI: 14

00:38:59.587 --> 00:39:00.671
Damn it.

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:03.090
We'll use mine.

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:04.133
But…

00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:07.970
Point deduction confirmed.

00:39:11.057 --> 00:39:11.932
It's okay.

00:39:13.934 --> 00:39:16.604
Fifth turn. Begin.

00:39:21.567 --> 00:39:23.736
Rei, did you get out?

00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:28.949
I'm still stuck here.
And I lost another point!

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:29.950
What?

00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:37.249
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:40.628
-Here, Yuna.
-You shouldn't have.

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:43.172
Sohta, Yuna. Where are you?

00:39:43.255 --> 00:39:44.590
You have great taste.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.344
This is far from finished.

00:39:48.427 --> 00:39:50.304
Sohta! Yuna!

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.557
Sohta! Yuna!

00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:03.317
This is far from finished.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:10.116
When push comes to shove,
people choose the future they want

00:40:11.617 --> 00:40:15.538
instead of helping others.

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:23.087
FROM: MOM
PLEASE JUST CALL ONCE

00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:29.718
This is far from finished.

00:40:30.302 --> 00:40:32.179
You're completely useless.

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:37.268
Come to think of it,
I wonder how Mom is doing.

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:42.982
Shit.

00:40:48.487 --> 00:40:49.780
Gimme one packet.

00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:52.450
That stuff rocked, right?

00:41:15.181 --> 00:41:16.348
No way in hell.

00:41:18.726 --> 00:41:20.978
Didn't I just toss the drugs?

00:41:27.443 --> 00:41:28.360
No!

00:41:29.737 --> 00:41:31.655
Shit! No!

00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:33.991
No!

00:41:46.462 --> 00:41:47.505
Mom.

00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:51.675
Your mother had
a severe cerebral hemorrhage.

00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:52.843
No way.

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:55.012
Nobu…

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:01.352
Even if she recovers,
I doubt she'll return to the life she had.

00:42:01.435 --> 00:42:02.937
This can't be true.

00:42:15.699 --> 00:42:16.534
Usagi.

00:42:17.284 --> 00:42:21.705
I'll go unlock Rei in D3,
so stay there again the next turn.

00:42:22.456 --> 00:42:23.332
Got it.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.501
Ryuji.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.004
Ryuji, can you hear me?
How are things there?

00:42:30.256 --> 00:42:32.925
Corner room E1 deducts one point.

00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:34.802
So no exit?

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.387
Nope.

00:42:52.486 --> 00:42:53.487
No.

00:42:55.114 --> 00:42:56.115
It can't be.

00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:06.584
No.

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:09.920
This can't be.

00:43:13.382 --> 00:43:14.383
I'm screwed.

00:43:19.054 --> 00:43:20.139
Mom.

00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:24.059
It's my fault.

00:43:29.815 --> 00:43:30.983
It's all my fault.

00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:09.897
This is far from finished.

00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:12.483
D2 UNLOCKED

00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:20.366
Room D2 has been unlocked.

00:44:23.702 --> 00:44:25.871
Rei, you should be able to move now.

00:44:27.706 --> 00:44:29.124
See you next turn.

00:44:31.585 --> 00:44:32.586
Roger that.

00:44:33.879 --> 00:44:34.838
Thanks.

00:44:54.024 --> 00:44:55.359
-4 ROOM
TETSU SHIMAZAKI: 12

00:44:55.442 --> 00:44:58.737
B3 is a minus-four-point room.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.532
Minus four?

00:45:03.409 --> 00:45:05.619
Point deduction confirmed.

00:45:12.084 --> 00:45:13.961
Tetsu? Nobu?

00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:17.798
Nobu! Answer me.

00:45:21.635 --> 00:45:25.222
There's nothing to worry about.
I still have points.

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:30.227
Point deduction confirmed.

00:45:42.698 --> 00:45:43.741
Shit.

00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:47.578
Goddammit!

00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:53.751
Sorry I'm late.

00:45:58.172 --> 00:45:59.173
No worries.

00:46:02.718 --> 00:46:03.719
Yukiko.

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:11.435
Hey, Yukiko.

00:46:11.518 --> 00:46:12.519
Yeah?

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.272
How about the aquarium
for our anniversary?

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:16.940
Why?

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:20.986
I've never been.

00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:23.030
Never in your entire life?

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:24.448
Yeah.

00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:28.076
Sure.

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:34.291
Long time no see. You look well.

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:09.660
Wow, look at you now.

00:47:11.578 --> 00:47:14.373
I'm working at an architectural firm.

00:47:14.915 --> 00:47:16.041
I can change.

00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:18.669
What? Really?

00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:22.464
I can change, Yukiko.

00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:45.320
Goddammit!

00:48:04.256 --> 00:48:05.799
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.384
Welcome.

00:48:14.099 --> 00:48:15.434
I've been waiting.

00:48:15.517 --> 00:48:16.935
Sorry I'm late.

00:48:17.019 --> 00:48:18.812
I didn't think you'd come.

00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:21.356
What? Why wouldn't I?

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:24.693
-Hey.
-What?

00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:28.155
-Want me to build you a house?
-Really?

00:48:28.238 --> 00:48:30.282
Yeah, what kind do you want?

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:34.828
Big and spacious.

00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:38.035
A3 is a minus-eight-point room.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.584
You now have zero points.

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:48.879
Game over.

00:50:54.426 --> 00:50:55.510
And there it is.

00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:03.518
Police. We have a search warrant.

00:51:06.813 --> 00:51:07.898
I found it!

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:19.201
What's going on?

00:51:19.284 --> 00:51:21.870
-It's nothing.
-You haven't changed at all!

00:51:21.953 --> 00:51:23.455
Shut your mouth!

00:51:24.039 --> 00:51:27.042
What about you? I thought you trusted me!

00:51:27.125 --> 00:51:29.169
I did trust you!

00:51:29.795 --> 00:51:31.171
I trusted you.

00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:33.465
That's why it hurts even more!

00:51:40.347 --> 00:51:42.766
I guess this is goodbye.

00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:06.248
This seems about right.

00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:22.305
It's my fault.

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:43.243
Nobu.

00:52:50.542 --> 00:52:52.294
Tell me what happened.

00:52:55.213 --> 00:52:56.631
Talk to me.

00:52:58.717 --> 00:52:59.676
Leave me alone.

00:53:01.595 --> 00:53:04.806
Tell me. I'm on your side.

00:53:22.574 --> 00:53:25.410
Whatever happens, I want you to live.

00:54:03.323 --> 00:54:04.324
Mom.

00:54:06.993 --> 00:54:08.078
I will.

00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:51.079
-Would you like to address the class?
-Of course.

00:54:51.162 --> 00:54:54.457
My name is Nobuaki Hida.
I'm a new teacher here.

00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:57.460
My mom was a teacher.

00:54:58.253 --> 00:55:00.964
I admired her, so I became one too.

00:55:02.257 --> 00:55:06.386
I'll try my best to be helpful
to you all as soon as possible.

00:55:11.516 --> 00:55:14.602
NOBUAKI HIDA

00:55:14.686 --> 00:55:20.483
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:24.154
I need to meet up with Tetsu.

00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:47.052
Nobu?

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:51.264
Where are you? Nobu?

00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:57.020
-1 ROOM
NOBUAKI HIDA: 4

00:55:57.103 --> 00:55:58.104
Nobu?

00:56:00.231 --> 00:56:01.941
I'm here, Sachiko.

00:56:02.734 --> 00:56:04.361
Are you all right?

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:08.656
I just went back to B1.

00:56:09.157 --> 00:56:11.201
But I got separated from Tetsu.

00:56:11.993 --> 00:56:15.747
Did you go to corner room A1?
That might be the exit.

00:56:16.456 --> 00:56:18.917
I did, but there wasn't an exit.

00:56:19.501 --> 00:56:22.337
We're in C1, right next to you.

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:25.924
We can meet up next turn,
so stay where you are.

00:56:26.007 --> 00:56:27.842
-Got it?
-Yeah.

00:56:31.096 --> 00:56:33.264
Seventh turn. Begin.

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:47.237
No way.

00:56:48.738 --> 00:56:49.739
One each.

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:52.742
We'll be split up.

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:04.838
Usagi, I'm now in D3.

00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:06.589
I finally met up with Rei.

00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:12.971
If there's no exit in corner room A1,
the remaining corners are A5 and E5.

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:16.057
I bet the exit is in one of them.

00:57:17.016 --> 00:57:20.353
Let's look for Sohta and Yuna.
They may know something.

00:57:20.437 --> 00:57:21.354
Understood.

00:57:33.741 --> 00:57:35.368
Another interview?

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:37.036
Actually…

00:57:39.205 --> 00:57:40.748
This is my research.

00:57:42.375 --> 00:57:43.668
"Near-death experiences"?

00:57:45.336 --> 00:57:47.505
I'm not sure my story helped you.

00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:48.506
Don't be silly.

00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:53.928
Let me thank you.
Anything you want to eat?

00:57:55.597 --> 00:57:56.973
Let me think…

00:58:12.906 --> 00:58:13.907
Let's go…

00:58:16.034 --> 00:58:17.744
to the world of death together.

00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:49.150
Kill her in the next game.

00:58:49.734 --> 00:58:51.778
That's your final job.

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:11.381
Your wish will be granted if you kill her.

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:18.680
You'll discover the true world of death
that lies beyond here.

00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:25.728
Ryuji, you there?

00:59:27.438 --> 00:59:28.356
Ryuji?

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:31.859
-Ryuji!
-Hold your wristband to…

00:59:31.943 --> 00:59:32.944
I can hear you.

00:59:34.153 --> 00:59:35.363
Let's meet up later.

00:59:37.031 --> 00:59:38.700
Let's meet up in B4.

00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:46.624
Okay, thank you. Thanks.

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:17.071
-Nobu!
-I'm so glad to see you!

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.865
-Thank goodness!
-I'm so glad.

01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:24.078
B1 is a minus-one-point room.

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:25.705
I'll use my points.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.336
We need to find Tetsu.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.756
Tetsu?

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.551
Tetsu? Answer me!

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:39.636
Tetsu?

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:42.430
Eighth turn. Begin.

01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:57.278
Sohta.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:00.948
Wow!

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:16.089
No.

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:33.815
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:42.740
Yuna.

01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:45.118
Sohta!

01:01:49.497 --> 01:01:50.331
Yuna?

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.126
Yuna!

01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:57.672
Sohta. I can't get through!

01:01:57.755 --> 01:01:59.048
Sohta!

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:00.258
Yuna!

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:05.930
B4 is a minus-two-point room.

01:02:06.013 --> 01:02:06.848
What?

01:02:06.931 --> 01:02:11.060
-2 ROOM

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:13.813
You now have zero points.

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:17.108
Game over.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:23.424
Sohta?

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:32.767
Yuna.

01:03:34.393 --> 01:03:36.979
This was a minus-two room.

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.108
What? It can't be.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:44.362
No.

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:46.531
I'm sorry, Yuna.

01:03:50.034 --> 01:03:51.828
I couldn't keep my promise.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.915
No, Sohta. Open up!

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:58.084
Someone open this! Please!

01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.877
No!

01:04:00.878 --> 01:04:03.631
No! Sohta, don't go!

01:04:03.714 --> 01:04:06.050
No! Don't go!

01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:07.134
No!

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:10.847
Please!

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:26.654
Promise me you'll be happy.

01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:29.866
No! Don't go!

01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:32.076
No! Please don't go!

01:04:32.159 --> 01:04:32.994
No!

01:05:30.509 --> 01:05:35.014
YUZUHA ARISU: 9, RYUJI MATSUYAMA: 7
NOBUAKI HIDA: 3, SACHIKO MAKINO: 11

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:36.223
Sohta has…

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.268
Yeah.

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:42.396
Tetsu isn't here either.

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.108
Tetsu.

01:05:48.235 --> 01:05:49.528
Where are you, Tetsu?

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:57.161
It's because I left him.

01:05:57.244 --> 01:05:58.329
We don't know

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:01.374
whether he's dead yet.

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:04.251
There's just no response.

01:06:08.839 --> 01:06:10.716
B4 is a minus-two room.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:12.802
Rei.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:23.062
I want you to go south to C5 with Yuna.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:27.525
Based on the turn count,
Yuna and her brother passed through E5.

01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:33.447
If E5 wasn't the exit,
then the only corner room left is A5.

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:34.907
Right.

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.828
I'll join the others in B4
before heading to A5.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:43.332
Corner room A5 has to be the exit.

01:06:56.804 --> 01:06:57.847
Yuna.

01:06:59.306 --> 01:07:01.183
Head to the exit with Rei.

01:07:03.936 --> 01:07:06.397
Listen, Yuna.

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.899
Let's go, okay?

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:10.401
Yuna.

01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:17.742
Hold your wristband to the chosen door
and proceed to the next room.

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:19.869
Let's go, Yuna.

01:07:42.516 --> 01:07:43.517
Sohta!

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:45.061
-Yuna!
-Yuna!

01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:47.438
You shouldn't see this! Go with Rei!

01:07:47.521 --> 01:07:48.689
Yuna, come back.

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:51.233
Hurry! This door will close too!

01:07:51.817 --> 01:07:53.194
Look out!

01:07:56.155 --> 01:08:00.451
The player left in this room
will be forced to stay.

01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:10.252
B4 is a minus-two-point room.

01:08:10.836 --> 01:08:14.423
Please select whose points to use.

01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:22.890
Point deduction confirmed.

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:27.895
-4 ROOM

01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:31.732
B3 is a minus-four-point room.

01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:33.359
Minus four points.

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:36.112
Let's use mine.

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:41.992
Point deduction confirmed.

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:45.579
Tenth turn. Begin.

01:09:07.768 --> 01:09:09.103
No…

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:19.238
Usagi, how's it going in there?

01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:22.449
Everyone is in room B3 now.

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:26.996
But our dice roll is forcing us
to split in three directions.

01:09:27.079 --> 01:09:30.749
Plus, one of us will be forced to stay.

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:33.294
And we still haven't met up with Tetsu.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:38.090
Tetsu isn't here in B4 either,
which means…

01:09:41.093 --> 01:09:43.721
Tetsu is in A3.

01:09:45.556 --> 01:09:46.557
Tetsu…

01:09:48.809 --> 01:09:52.354
That room might deduct a lot of points.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:56.192
Then what should we do?

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:04.366
One of you goes
to the high-deduction room.

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:06.994
The second goes to the minus-two room.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.622
The third moves away from the exit.

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:14.335
And the fourth will be forced to stay.

01:10:25.095 --> 01:10:27.348
What the hell, you bitch?!

01:10:27.431 --> 01:10:28.474
Stop it!

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:29.808
Stop!

01:10:30.517 --> 01:10:31.894
Enough!

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:34.396
Stop it.

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:52.373
Let's go to the world of death together.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.199
Think.

01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:31.745
Come on.

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:35.332
I gotta think.

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:39.795
Think.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:17.624
EXIT

01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:08.003
