00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.340
[Episode 4]

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.490
Hao.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.050
Uncle Ma, why did you bring someone here?

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.120
He's one of us.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.530
What kind of stuff?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.410
You're good. You're the best.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.940
It's really good stuff.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.100
Where did you get it?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.980
Uncle Ma.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.050
Promise me.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.040
I'll sell this

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.010
to pay for Lili's Grandma's surgery

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.670
and help you pay off your debt.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.090
Then please let Duozai go

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.260
and leave in peace.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.750
Duozai is lucky

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.270
to have a friend like you.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.540
But I'm worried

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.630
if the stuff goes to Gold-Tooth Wan,

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.160
he'll just take it all for himself.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.950
Why?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.410
What do you mean why?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.800
You know what Gold-Tooth Wan is like.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.520
Don't pretend you don't.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.120
Think about it.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.630
I can make you
a lot of money selling this stuff.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.160
Just give me a straight answer.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.630
Me or Gold-Tooth Wan?

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.650
You can trust Mr. Zhen.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.790
Yeah, right.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.030
Mr. Wan.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.260
Ma Yong.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.110
You dare show up here?

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.079
I'll settle all accounts with you now.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.910
Mr. Wan. Mr. Wan.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.240
I've got a big deal for you.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.190
A big deal.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.910
I'll slap you to death.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.170
It's a big deal for you!

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.240
Look at you,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.520
claiming you have a big deal.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.490
Idiot. Get lost.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.310
Mr. Wan.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.320
It's premium stuff,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.430
really good.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.610
For you to sell.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.220
Get him a tissue.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.730
Braised Pork?

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.710
It really is Braised Pork.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.980
Where did you get it?

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.870
Mr. Wan.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.980
About the source...

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.310
Well...

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.500
Get lost.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.210
Boy.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.720
Where did you get it?

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.230
From a friend.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.710
Which friend?

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.710
A friend of mine.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.800
Is it Lili?

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.010
Of course not.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.480
If Lili didn't need money,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.210
I wouldn't be involved in this.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.600
Mr. Wan.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.110
He needs the money.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.430
Name your price.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.070
Mr. Wan,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.310
I can sell it for 2,000

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.870
at least.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.750
Would it kill you to shut up?

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.120
Loudmouth.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.330
1,000.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.180
Keep the profit for Mr. Wan.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.970
1,000.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.110
Am I making the offer, or are you?

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.480
You are.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.930
Here's the case.

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:34.480
I can offer 1,000.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.320
Figure out how heavy this is.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.510
Boss, 100 grams.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.620
100 grams.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.500
Two boxes is 200 grams.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.870
I'll pay 1,000.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.240
200 grams.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.720
200 grams.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.159
200,000.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.980
Thank you, Mr. Wan.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.480
But this amount is too little.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.390
I have a big appetite.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.390
Look.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.180
Get me at least

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.140
two more kilos.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.830
Alright?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.860
I don't have that much stuff, Mr. Wan.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.310
Ask that friend of yours.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.360
How much does he have?

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.440
I want it all.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.480
Fine.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.890
I'll go back and ask.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.340
Let me go back first.

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:41.020
Ask right here.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.070
Mr. Wan.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.800
Let's take things one step at a time.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.730
That stuff...

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.700
The Pork...

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.480
We don't even know where it comes from.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.560
Give him some time.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.040
Let him think about it...

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.920
Shut up.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.159
If you don't give me an answer today,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.850
nobody's leaving.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.910
Mr. Wan.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.740
That's not how the rules work.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.410
I am the rules.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.870
Cooperate and you're my friend.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.340
If you don't cooperate, you're my enemy.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.240
Your choice.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.160
Bro.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880
What do you think?

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.430
Mr. Wan.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.510
Get away.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.520
Come here.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.180
Think about it.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.560
This is a great opportunity to get rich,

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.000
isn't it?

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.050
Two kilos is

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.120
2 million.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.159
Just imagine.

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:47.920
If it's 200 kilos,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.600
how much would that be?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.720
That's...

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.440
Two...

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.570
Two kilos is...

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.000
200 million.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.659
Did you calculate correctly?

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.380
200 million!

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.370
Have you ever seen that much money?

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.680
You have 200 million?

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.510
I don't.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.830
I can sell it myself.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.720
We're going to cooperate.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.310
Otherwise, what are we doing here then?

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.240
200 million.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.800
Boy.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.480
What's there to hesitate about?

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.310
Is there really that much stuff?

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.720
Think about it.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.390
If we can get that much stuff

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.440
and make that much money,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.600
we'll never have to live

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.680
in fear again.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.850
And think about this, too.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.440
Three parts fate,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.770
seven parts fight.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:08.240
Only those who dare to fight will win.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.040
Duozai has been living too miserably.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.440
I want to turn my life around.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.450
Heaven on one side,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.150
hell on the other.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.320
Your choice!

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.380
Let's do it!

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.310
That's right.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.870
Is anyone there?

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.210
Where're my stuff?

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.890
Who are you?

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.070
Why did you tie me up?

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:56.910
Let me go now!

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.470
Where's Fatty Xin's stuff?

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.720
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.390
Untie me right now...

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.080
Do you know?

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.390
Do you know?

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.270
Where is it?

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.780
I really don't know.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.330
I don't know what you're...

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.790
Kid.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.000
Answer my questions properly.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.020
Or I'll kill you and feed you to the fish.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.760
Where're the stuff?

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.050
I don't know
what stuff you're talking about.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.440
All that stuff!

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.460
All that money!

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.380
You might not live to spend it!

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.860
Where are they?

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.310
If I had money,

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.360
I wouldn't be delivering food.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.120
I really don't know.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.310
What is it?

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.390
I'll ask one last time.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.360
What is that stuff?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.280
I don't know.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.830
Do you know or not?

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.210
What is that stuff?

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.580
What is it?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.510
Where is it?

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.830
Mou Sen!

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.910
Turn on the video call.
I have something good to show you.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.630
Look here, Mou Sen.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.950
Take a look at your brother.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.180
Let me tell you.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:18.960
Without the stuff,

Xin Chuanyong

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.920
Find out the location.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.130
Everyone be ready to move.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:53.960
Roger that.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.400
Get up.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.110
Get up!

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.650
Were you sleeping that deeply?

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.080
Find a chance to take them out.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.760
Four-Eyes.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.880
Where are you? Come here.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.940
Where's the stuff?

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:42.080
It's down there.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.520
Are you sure it's down there?

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.410
Where are you going?

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.960
Come here.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.020
Keep an eye on them.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.270
You, don't move.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.060
Watch them carefully.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.370
You lead the way.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:56.930
Let's go.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.160
Which way?

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:00.320
Move it.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:14.550
I've already locked

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:16.810
the exact location of that phone number.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.750
[Location Management platform]

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:26.910
Support me a bt.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.040
What a dump.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.720
The best stuff
is always in dumps like this.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.750
That big of a move?

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.360
Whose car is this?

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.890
Some boss's car.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.880
That tells me nothing.

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:05.000
Is it safe?

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.010
It's safe. I've been here before.

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:55.780
Awesome!

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.620
Thank the Goddess Mazu!

00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.980
I'm rich!

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.490
I'm rich!

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:05.380
Very good!

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:06.760
Very good, boy.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.940
Listen.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.760
Go upstairs now.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.080
Get my guys

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.300
to come down and help move this stuff.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.540
Hurry up!
