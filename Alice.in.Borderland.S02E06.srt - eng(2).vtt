00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:10.051
Round 13.
Three minutes remaining.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.608
I don't want you.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.350
Damn it!

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:48.191
There are two players
remaining until checkmate.

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.987
Miss?

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:04.124
Nobody cared
about saving that kid.

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.919
When given the option,
they sided with the Queen.

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:14.717
They'll do whatever it takes not to die.
It's a fact.

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:19.222
Nobody wants to see a child be killed.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.684
But in the end,
everyone wants to save their own skin.

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:25.145
Each and every human being is that way.

00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:28.940
Then I guess…

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.278
you've never met somebody

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:36.614
that you really cared about.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:47.417
Fucking hypocrites like you
make me wanna throw up.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.049
If you really cared
about this kid so much,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.677
you'd die with him.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.390
But something tells me
you'll change your mind soon.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.642
You will.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:19.365
Are you okay?

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.119
I promise

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:27.081
I won't stop protecting you.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:33.713
Round 14.
Challenger Team's turn beginning.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:37.050
This turn will last five minutes.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.511
Turn, start.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.628
Usagi!

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.088
Stay where you are!

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.973
- You okay?
- I have an idea.

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:08.141
Follow me.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:15.857
Ow!

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.915
You all right?

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:34.334
Did you see them?

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:37.211
Okay, there isn't much time
left on the clock, so we have to--

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.421
Run!

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.266
Usagi. We need to capture five more.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.185
I saw people upstairs. Let's go!

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:53.144
Wait!

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:55.480
Let's go! Come on, Usagi.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:56.522
Wait.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.990
You guys…

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.744
Do you really wanna
keep working for the Queen?

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:12.789
Yeah, of course we do.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:14.916
We don't wanna die.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.127
If we keep playing for the Queen's side
and we win,

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.754
then we can stay right here.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.257
If we're in this arena,
we don't need to play anything else.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:25.802
No getting hunted down or shot.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.764
You've gotta be kidding me.
Winning isn't the most important thing!

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:31.849
Right now? Yeah. Yeah, it is.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.937
No. You're wrong about that.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:39.649
Listen.

00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:44.946
The most important thing
isn't just winning the game!

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.867
It's getting back to our world.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:56.457
If all you really care about is winning,

00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:59.419
then sure, you're doing everything right.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:03.673
You're protected by the Queen,
and you can live in this world forever.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.844
But is that what you want?

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:12.140
If our side wins, we can beat the Queen.

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.767
If we beat every single face card game,

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:17.311
then there's a chance…

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.522
a chance we can get back home again.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:26.279
There's no going back there.
Ever.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.115
That world's all over.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.034
It's just over.

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:35.663
These games have rules,
just like the rest.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:39.876
The face card guys,
if they lose, they get killed.

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:42.044
Just like us.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.671
Which means if we beat them,

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.048
then there won't be anyone else.

00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:49.469
This will all end
if we win every face card game.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.763
That's just a guess, man,
and nothing more.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.932
Yeah, a guess.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:56.767
And hope.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:00.605
Maybe hope is what we need to survive.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.440
I won't give up.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.819
Sure, you can extend
your lives here with the Queen.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:08.905
But what does that mean?

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.868
Y-- you're spending the rest of your lives
killing each other.

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:18.748
That's not a life.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.836
Why don't you take a chance with us?

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:32.553
This place
isn't that different from our world.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.892
You guys want to go back
to our world so badly?

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.103
That place sucked.

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.190
Maybe…

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.194
Maybe this one'll be better.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:00.581
Yeah.

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:04.168
I thought the same until recently.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.548
Going back might not be all that great.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.011
But you know…

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.599
I want to go back, I really do.

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:25.648
I wanna make it back to our world.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.029
For all the pain and heartache
I lived with,

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.158
I was born and raised there.

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:40.413
And it made me who I am today.

00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:43.541
I miss that world.

00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:50.631
At times, it was unbearably lonely.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.263
But I believe it taught me kindness.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.016
That life that I had…

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:04.020
I'm kind here because it made me that way.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.027
This world makes kindness easy to forget.

00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:20.578
I want to return.

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:25.333
I want to give that life another shot.

00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:42.475
I…

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:45.353
I wanna go back.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.358
I do.

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:54.904
I want to return and see

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.365
my family.

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:16.759
Do you think…

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.429
Could I start over?

00:11:24.892 --> 00:11:27.645
Two turns remaining.

00:11:27.728 --> 00:11:31.482
Round 15 is the final one
for the Queen Team.

00:11:31.565 --> 00:11:34.235
This turn will last five minutes.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.529
Turn, start.

00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:04.849
They have 14 on their side?

00:12:04.932 --> 00:12:07.476
We need to get back five people
for a majority.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.311
How do we do that in just one turn?

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.605
The other side can win just by running.

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:14.775
Okay, then.
We chase and catch them one by one.

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:16.569
Wait.

00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:23.993
There's one more option.

00:12:29.957 --> 00:12:33.085
{\an8}I want that guy on our side
before the game's over.

00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:35.588
And the woman?

00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:39.842
I don't want her.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:44.638
Let's teach her that fake virtues
have no place in this world.

00:12:46.807 --> 00:12:48.058
- Aah!
- Let's go!

00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:54.857
Come here!

00:12:58.235 --> 00:12:59.445
Stop running!

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:03.908
Okay. Run!

00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:16.295
Down there!

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:18.589
Stop running!

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.892
We don't need you. Move!

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:35.272
After her!

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:42.363
- This way!
- All right!

00:13:53.123 --> 00:13:54.250
You, upstairs!

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.584
Run.

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:01.340
Over there!

00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:05.427
Found him!

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.513
Woo-hoo!

00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:08.597
Faster!

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:24.446
Round 15 is ending shortly.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.824
Thirty seconds remaining.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.386
Grab him!

00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:56.812
Final turn, start.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.606
Go!

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.448
Arisu!

00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:12.578
They went that way!

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:20.002
Get him!

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.420
- Oh! Oh!
- We did it! Yeah!

00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:23.547
- I can't believe it!
- Fuck, yeah!

00:15:45.569 --> 00:15:47.071
- Yeah!
- Yes!

00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:48.322
We won!

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:50.783
- This is incredible!
- We won!

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:55.162
Yeah, we did so great!

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:57.456
We pulled through!

00:15:57.539 --> 00:15:58.624
- Yes!
- We showed them!

00:15:58.707 --> 00:16:00.376
- We did it. We won.
- Yes!

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:03.128
- Oh yes!
- That was so bad!

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:06.298
- We pulled through. You pulled through!
- No, you were great!

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.635
- Great! Well done! Well done!
- Yes!

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:22.147
I don't know
how you convinced everyone.

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.942
But congratulations,

00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:26.902
Miss Goody Two-Shoes.

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:30.197
When I go back,

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:33.409
I'm not going to be alone.

00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:35.703
I'm leaving with my friends.

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.163
They matter.

00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.667
That's what you think?

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:46.296
You have way more freedom here, you know.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:51.427
This place is much more my scene
than that rigid world.

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.138
You were players, weren't you?

00:16:55.222 --> 00:16:57.850
You were brought here to play,
just like us.

00:16:57.933 --> 00:16:59.601
You had to play the games.

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:01.854
Well, am I wrong?

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:07.860
Oh, you'll find out soon enough.

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:10.529
- Once the games are done.
- Not before then?

00:17:12.072 --> 00:17:14.074
What'll we learn when they're all over?

00:17:16.076 --> 00:17:18.537
First you clear all the face cards.

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.165
Then you'll know everything.

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:23.834
Will we learn where we are?

00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:26.003
Can we go back to our world?

00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:31.550
You'll have to wait and find out, baby.

00:17:33.093 --> 00:17:34.970
- Time is up.
- Hey!

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:39.266
It is game over for everyone
on the Queen's Team.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.604
I wanna live free until my last breath.

00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:47.483
See you later.

00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:39.284
I want to finish these games.

00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:41.870
I want the answer.

00:18:44.998 --> 00:18:46.208
But more than that…

00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:50.170
I wanna go back to our world.

00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:54.383
Both of us together.

00:19:00.722 --> 00:19:01.723
So do I.

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:15.404
Hey, look.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.832
That smell…

00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:30.002
Did you fart?

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:31.962
Of course not!

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:17.216
Hot!

00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:21.970
Wow!

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:24.181
It's a hot spring!

00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:25.682
There's a hot spring!

00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:28.727
Usagi! Look!

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.021
- It's really a hot spring!
- Oh…

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.815
The water's perfect over here!

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:36.109
Really? Then let's get in!

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:39.947
When's the last time we took a bath?
We can't pass this up!

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.366
- Huh? Together?
- Huh…

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.327
Huh? Oh…

00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:08.016
I could die right now and I'd be happy.

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:13.730
I just wish that…

00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:17.734
the painful memories washed away
as easily as dirt.

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:21.905
Yeah, I know.

00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:28.578
What's wrong?

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.289
Usagi?

00:21:32.582 --> 00:21:33.625
Usagi?

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:36.753
Hey!

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:38.922
Usagi?

00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:44.386
That's not possible.

00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:48.181
They can't be real, can they?

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:09.286
They're taking a bath too.

00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:14.082
Maybe they escaped from a zoo
or something.

00:22:17.377 --> 00:22:19.046
If we hadn't been brought here,

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.882
we'd have never seen this.

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:24.634
Yeah.

00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:29.723
You know what's kind of crazy?

00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:32.684
I'm feeling emotional.

00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:35.812
And I'm not entirely sure why.

00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:41.943
Right there with you.

00:22:59.336 --> 00:23:01.671
I'm sorry. I didn't see anything!

00:23:01.755 --> 00:23:05.133
Just elephants! I'm only looking at them.

00:23:05.759 --> 00:23:07.302
I love elephants.

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:08.595
It's okay.

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.140
You can stay.

00:26:02.686 --> 00:26:03.728
Found it.

00:26:24.207 --> 00:26:26.793
KIMIKO KUINA
ADMITTED: JUNE 2, 2021

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.027
Mom, I wanna see you again.

00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:05.975
This makes me sick.

00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:10.146
All the work of some twisted fuck.

00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:16.027
Stuff like this
makes me lose hope for humanity.

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:19.322
This person knew
they were gonna die.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.450
But they fought until the very end.

00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:27.163
They didn't give up hope.

00:28:50.645 --> 00:28:52.147
There's still hope here.

00:29:23.845 --> 00:29:28.057
SUPREME COURT

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.200
Fascinating.

00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:49.120
So you were the King of Diamonds
all along.

00:29:49.746 --> 00:29:51.706
The Beach executive.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.875
Former Number Two.

00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:55.335
Kuzuryu.

00:29:57.712 --> 00:30:00.924
Why was the King of Diamonds at the Beach?

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:04.886
I was curious.

00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:07.138
Undercover, then.

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:12.143
Difficulty, King of Diamonds.

00:30:12.227 --> 00:30:15.230
Game, Beauty Contest.

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:19.067
Let us begin.

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:38.002
Rules.
Contestants have three minutes

00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:41.464
to choose a number between zero and 100.

00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:47.512
{\an8}The average of the numbers
everyone selected is multiplied by 0.8.

00:30:47.595 --> 00:30:52.225
{\an8}The person who chose the number
closest to that result is the winner.

00:30:53.434 --> 00:30:58.690
Multiply the average value
of what we all chose by 0.8.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.820
Whoever's number
is closest to that result wins.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.321
Hmm?

00:31:05.405 --> 00:31:09.075
Multiply the average value by 0.8?

00:31:10.326 --> 00:31:13.288
Why 0.8? What's 0.8 mean?

00:31:14.455 --> 00:31:15.540
I get it.

00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:19.294
Multiplying the average
by the fixed value of 0.8

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:21.045
disrupts the scale's balance.

00:31:22.463 --> 00:31:23.673
That's why it's a game.

00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:26.259
0.8 is a drop.

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:29.262
A single drop straight from heaven.

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:34.142
One point will be deducted
from the four losers,

00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:36.644
and the round is concluded.

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:42.317
When a player reaches negative ten points,
they will receive a game over.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.945
The last player standing
will clear the game.

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:51.367
However, every time a player
is eliminated, a new rule is added.

00:31:51.451 --> 00:31:54.329
A new rule? What's with that?

00:31:57.123 --> 00:31:59.834
And nobody's explaining these scales.

00:32:00.335 --> 00:32:03.922
Round one, start.

00:32:17.894 --> 00:32:19.312
Hmm…

00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:45.922
Time limit reached.

00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:51.260
The average of the numbers
chosen in the first round

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.180
is 32.8.

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:58.434
After multiplying this value by 0.8,

00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:02.480
the player closest to this number

00:33:02.563 --> 00:33:04.357
is Master Kuzuryu,

00:33:05.024 --> 00:33:06.067
the winner.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.784
If everyone picked 40,

00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:17.996
then the average value

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:20.039
would be 40, of course.

00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:22.792
Multiplying that by 0.8 is 32.

00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:25.586
Even if everyone anticipated that
and chose 32,

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:29.173
multiplying the average value by 0.8
will yield a lower number.

00:33:29.257 --> 00:33:31.009
So that won't work.

00:33:31.092 --> 00:33:33.678
If everyone picks the same, that means

00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:37.348
getting stuck in a cycle and no one wins.

00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:40.435
So we can't do that. Nah.

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.478
Ah, I understand.

00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:46.733
You just need to predict your opponents'
moves and be a few steps ahead.

00:33:46.816 --> 00:33:50.153
Mmm… This feels like a heart
more than a diamond.

00:33:50.903 --> 00:33:52.739
Hmm! We're reading each other.

00:33:52.822 --> 00:33:55.241
Whether you play poker or chess,

00:33:55.324 --> 00:33:58.661
in an intellectual game,
you have to read your opponent.

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:01.456
Not reading their minds,

00:34:02.165 --> 00:34:03.958
but predicting their reasoning.

00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:06.085
Wouldn't you say?

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:09.797
Huh, King?

00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:12.592
Their reasoning?

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:20.933
You ignoring me?

00:34:23.603 --> 00:34:24.604
What's that?

00:34:25.354 --> 00:34:26.397
Water?

00:34:29.275 --> 00:34:31.360
That is sulfuric acid.

00:34:31.444 --> 00:34:34.572
- What?
- Oh, so you'll answer him…

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:38.910
If someone reaches
negative ten points, the scales will tip.

00:34:40.453 --> 00:34:42.080
It'll melt our bodies.

00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:45.875
Best case, we end up horribly disfigured.

00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:53.424
Scales, well…

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.469
Let me guess.

00:34:56.552 --> 00:34:58.513
The King of Diamonds is a lawyer.

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:00.389
At least, he used to be.

00:35:02.308 --> 00:35:04.060
Yes, but that's in the past.

00:35:04.644 --> 00:35:05.853
That bad, was it?

00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:09.982
But even so, you selected this venue.

00:35:11.734 --> 00:35:14.821
Interesting game arena, the Supreme Court.

00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:18.282
This giant installation.

00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:21.786
The badge a lawyer wears
represents equality and fairness.

00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:25.623
All life, including yours,
is equally valuable.

00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:28.501
Is that what you wanna say?

00:35:28.584 --> 00:35:30.378
What you want us to understand?

00:35:32.713 --> 00:35:36.884
The scale will always tip
to whatever side has more gold.

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:40.388
Not all life has the same value, you know.

00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:47.436
Round two, start.

00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:50.606
Since 26 was the answer before,

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.401
maybe I'll multiply that by 0.8 this time?

00:35:54.026 --> 00:35:56.946
No, everyone might be
thinking the same thing.

00:35:57.029 --> 00:35:59.699
Ah, maybe I'll multiply it by another 0.8?

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:02.827
Suppose everyone chooses 100.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:05.830
The product after multiplying it by 0.8
would be 80.

00:36:05.913 --> 00:36:09.417
In order to win, picking a number
higher than 80 is pointless.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.921
{\an8}If 80 is the highest average we can have,
multiplying it by 0.8 is 64.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:19.010
If the highest average is 64,
then multiplying that by 0.8 is 51.2.

00:36:19.093 --> 00:36:20.219
So 51.

00:36:20.928 --> 00:36:23.890
{\an8}And we can go on and on,
getting closer and closer to zero.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.392
The law of the stock market is to invest

00:36:26.475 --> 00:36:28.686
in stocks that
everyone wants to invest in.

00:36:29.478 --> 00:36:32.023
You have to predict everyone's desires.

00:36:32.106 --> 00:36:34.734
The crux of this game
is to read a few steps ahead

00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:36.694
of everyone else's deductions.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.866
There are already equations that exist
to help read an opponent's rationality.

00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:44.368
{\an8}Time limit reached.

00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:48.664
The average of the numbers
chosen in the second round

00:36:48.748 --> 00:36:51.209
is 16.6.

00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:54.921
After multiplying this value by 0.8,

00:36:56.088 --> 00:36:58.466
the player closest to this number

00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:02.511
is Master Kuzuryu, the winner.

00:37:16.525 --> 00:37:18.653
You were even closer this time.

00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:22.490
The number is getting smaller.

00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:24.659
So, what, we're supposed to pick zero?

00:37:26.827 --> 00:37:29.247
The rational conclusion
would be zero.

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:32.416
In other words,
everyone will pick zero in the end.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.588
Picking zero
is the most rational choice.

00:37:37.672 --> 00:37:41.550
But the rational limit
is different for everyone.

00:37:45.012 --> 00:37:46.138
Kuzuryu.

00:37:47.807 --> 00:37:48.641
What?

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:51.394
I think I understand now.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.522
The thing that you're trying to measure…

00:37:56.816 --> 00:37:58.484
it's the value of life, isn't it?

00:38:02.238 --> 00:38:03.281
No, it's not.

00:38:04.156 --> 00:38:05.574
Then what are you doing?

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:07.910
You can tell me.

00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:23.259
Perhaps we could propose
a new settlement figure?

00:38:23.759 --> 00:38:27.972
The contaminants that the factory dumped
actually did cause environmental issues.

00:38:28.055 --> 00:38:31.183
Twenty people in the surrounding community
died as a result.

00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:33.519
Diseases can be caused
by many factors.

00:38:34.353 --> 00:38:36.939
What proof is there
that our company is responsible?

00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:42.361
I heard that you were
an extremely talented lawyer,

00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:44.989
but it seems
you do not understand the law.

00:38:45.614 --> 00:38:49.201
Laws don't exist
to protect the weak from the powerful.

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:52.038
Everyone is equal
in the eyes of the law, sir.

00:38:52.121 --> 00:38:53.289
That is naive.

00:38:56.459 --> 00:38:58.878
In order to save starving people,

00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:02.423
you first need the power
to influence the world's economy.

00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:07.053
Your principles are not enough to change
a world so full of contradictions.

00:39:07.803 --> 00:39:08.804
Let me ask you.

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:15.978
What do you think we should do
to maintain a respectable, modern society?

00:39:19.106 --> 00:39:20.649
We need a justice system.

00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:23.694
A fair justice system
must exist at all levels.

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:25.905
You mentioned…

00:39:26.405 --> 00:39:29.909
You mentioned the importance
of respecting the world's economy.

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:33.454
But prioritizing economic growth
will create more inequality.

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:34.747
- A wealth gap--
- No!

00:39:35.581 --> 00:39:39.377
Your duty as a lawyer
isn't to make sound arguments.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.754
Any fool is able to preach equality.

00:39:42.421 --> 00:39:46.926
Fairness and justice have no place
in a world more full of monsters than men.

00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:51.430
However, thanks to the power
of human imagination,

00:39:51.514 --> 00:39:54.308
we can make an unfair argument
sound fair and just.

00:39:55.017 --> 00:39:56.977
And you will do just that.

00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:59.814
It is your solemn duty
that is given to you by God.

00:40:09.448 --> 00:40:11.826
Time limit reached.

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:14.412
The results of the third round.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.749
100?

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:21.836
The average of the numbers is 20.2.

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:24.880
After multiplying this value by 0.8,

00:40:24.964 --> 00:40:28.634
the player closest to this number
is Master Daimon, the winner.

00:40:28.717 --> 00:40:30.386
Huh? I won?

00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:31.429
I won?

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:32.763
Ah! Yes!

00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:34.473
What's up, man?

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:36.851
Why'd you do that?

00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:40.146
You picked 100.
That means you'll always lose.

00:40:40.229 --> 00:40:43.149
There's a zero percent chance of winning,
don't you know?

00:40:44.024 --> 00:40:46.944
I think all of you are overthinking this.

00:40:48.404 --> 00:40:50.823
That kind of stuff
just gives me a headache.

00:40:51.907 --> 00:40:53.409
So I blew it up.

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:04.795
Wow, you're insane.

00:41:09.758 --> 00:41:13.554
The winner of round six
is Master Chishiya.

00:41:20.269 --> 00:41:22.897
The winner of round seven is…

00:41:24.106 --> 00:41:25.524
…Master Daimon.

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:30.821
Oh yeah!

00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:41.749
{\an8}I definitely don't wanna die like that.

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:47.713
I'm at minus nine points.

00:41:47.796 --> 00:41:49.924
If I miss any more, I die.

00:41:50.424 --> 00:41:52.551
My formula must be foolproof.

00:41:57.139 --> 00:42:01.352
What do I do? I'm so lost here.
I can't use the same strategy.

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:04.438
I can't make a single mistake.

00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:06.857
The next time I lose, it's game over.

00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:10.152
Rationally speaking,

00:42:10.903 --> 00:42:13.739
the average
should be getting closer to zero.

00:42:16.992 --> 00:42:19.119
I bet he predicted this outcome.

00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:33.008
The winner of round ten is…

00:42:34.009 --> 00:42:36.220
…Master Kuzuryu.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.935
Two players
now have negative ten points.

00:42:48.274 --> 00:42:51.819
It is game over
for these participants.

00:42:59.577 --> 00:43:03.163
Take this off! Someone!
I'll do anything!

00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:08.544
Don't! Ah! Take this off!
Hey! Take this off!

00:43:08.627 --> 00:43:09.670
What do you want, huh?

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:12.089
You want money? Please!

00:43:12.172 --> 00:43:14.341
What can I do?

00:43:15.718 --> 00:43:18.220
Please, stop this! Just stop!

00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:13.484
Now, this is more like a face card game.

00:44:14.943 --> 00:44:17.363
Is this the equality you're after?

00:44:19.531 --> 00:44:22.076
As two players were eliminated,

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.787
two new rules will be added.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:26.288
Rule number one.

00:44:26.372 --> 00:44:29.291
If two or more players choose
the same number,

00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:33.337
they will be disqualified from the round
and will each lose one point.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.005
Rule number two.

00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:36.965
Choosing the exact correct number

00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:41.303
will cause the other players
to lose two points instead of one.

00:45:08.163 --> 00:45:10.708
Results for round 11.

00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:18.132
All of us picked zero?

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:23.345
All three players picked the same number
and are disqualified from the round.

00:45:23.429 --> 00:45:25.806
All three players lose one point.

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:27.099
Huh?

00:45:27.182 --> 00:45:29.560
Everyone ended up
choosing the same number.

00:45:31.103 --> 00:45:35.065
If that happens one more time,
it's game over for me.

00:45:36.775 --> 00:45:39.570
Round 12, start.

00:45:50.205 --> 00:45:52.624
Results for round 12.

00:46:02.468 --> 00:46:05.679
{\an8}As the winner chose
the exact correct number,

00:46:06.346 --> 00:46:09.516
{\an8}the other two players
will lose two points.

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:13.145
No way.

00:46:13.228 --> 00:46:15.981
No way! This can't be happening!
How did you…

00:46:17.524 --> 00:46:19.443
You saw my answer, didn't you?

00:46:19.526 --> 00:46:21.278
He cheated! He did!

00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:24.698
You did! How else would you be able
to know which number I chose?

00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:26.992
I knew it because I've been watching.

00:46:27.826 --> 00:46:31.455
At the start of the last round,
you had negative eight points,

00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:33.749
and I had negative nine.

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:37.836
Even if you lost,
you'd still get another chance.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.714
So you took a risk,
thinking we'd eliminate each other.

00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:44.510
I thought about that,
and I figured you'd pick a random number.

00:46:44.593 --> 00:46:47.471
You want us to believe
you just guessed?

00:46:47.554 --> 00:46:48.472
Impossible!

00:46:48.555 --> 00:46:50.307
I knew what you thought we'd pick.

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:52.935
Odds are we'd choose numbers under 50.

00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:56.855
It's like he read my mind.

00:46:57.689 --> 00:47:01.276
The King was up by three points before.

00:47:09.451 --> 00:47:12.454
I couldn't catch up
if we chose the same number.

00:47:17.793 --> 00:47:22.130
{\an8}But I still had a chance if I could
get them to pick the same number.

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:30.055
So you'd have to avoid
numbers under 50.

00:47:30.722 --> 00:47:32.766
And if you were going to do that,

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:35.561
you'd have to avoid them
by a large margin.

00:47:36.144 --> 00:47:40.983
{\an8}Even so, you wouldn't pick too high.
Ninety and up is too much.

00:47:41.066 --> 00:47:42.693
{\an8}So over 50, under 90.

00:47:42.776 --> 00:47:46.154
{\an8}When you ask people to guess a number,
a few things come to mind.

00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:48.115
{\an8}Double digits, so they're out.

00:47:48.824 --> 00:47:52.494
{\an8}Same thing with nice, round numbers
divisible by ten.

00:47:52.578 --> 00:47:56.081
When you put someone on the spot
and ask them to choose a number,

00:47:56.164 --> 00:47:58.458
they'll usually go for eights,
threes and fives,

00:47:58.542 --> 00:48:00.586
and some of those are prime.

00:48:00.669 --> 00:48:02.212
You'd try not to pick them.

00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:04.256
Not too many options left now.

00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:06.925
How do we narrow the list further?

00:48:07.009 --> 00:48:09.428
Some of these numbers we see every day.

00:48:09.928 --> 00:48:11.263
Game systems,

00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:13.473
movie titles,

00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:14.892
brand logos.

00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:17.019
Easy associations.

00:48:17.102 --> 00:48:20.856
By my count, that just leaves 62 and 74.

00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:22.691
No way to narrow it down.

00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:25.569
So I… Well,

00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:27.988
I got lucky.

00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:32.826
I knew
I shouldn't have picked 74.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:38.332
A player now has negative ten points.

00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:44.004
No, no. No. No, no!

00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:45.672
No! No, no!

00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:46.840
Don't!

00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:48.091
Please! Just let me go.

00:48:48.175 --> 00:48:50.260
I'll do anything! Let me go! Let me go!

00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:51.845
No!

00:49:07.653 --> 00:49:08.612
Well…

00:49:10.405 --> 00:49:13.200
She said that not all lives

00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:15.410
have the same value.

00:49:17.412 --> 00:49:19.164
Think she still believed it?

00:49:19.915 --> 00:49:21.792
Up until the bitter end?

00:49:26.088 --> 00:49:27.130
Tell me…

00:49:28.674 --> 00:49:32.386
Have you ever peered behind the curtain,
seen how the world really works?

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:39.476
Watched children die because their parents
couldn't afford a few yen for medicine?

00:49:41.103 --> 00:49:44.523
Seen girls sold off
to pay for their parents' debts?

00:49:47.025 --> 00:49:50.445
Been powerless
to break the cycle of poverty?

00:49:54.408 --> 00:49:57.285
A new rule is being added.

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:02.082
If a player chooses zero as their number,

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:06.044
the other player will win
if they choose 100.

00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:09.047
A-ha.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.843
Since there's only two players
left in the game at this point,

00:50:13.635 --> 00:50:15.762
the one who picks closer to zero

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:18.181
is inevitably going to be the winner.

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:20.267
Just math.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:25.564
So if you pick zero each time, you'll win.
You're further from negative ten.

00:50:25.647 --> 00:50:27.941
But this new rule changes everything.

00:50:28.567 --> 00:50:29.943
I still have a chance.

00:50:31.028 --> 00:50:32.988
If you choose zero,

00:50:33.071 --> 00:50:35.240
I can win by choosing 100.

00:50:37.159 --> 00:50:39.870
But then if you think I'll choose 100,

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:44.082
you can choose one, and you'll win.

00:50:45.834 --> 00:50:47.461
Three choices.

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:50.297
It all comes down to three choices.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.133
Zero, one, and 100.

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:56.011
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:51:00.807 --> 00:51:03.018
But I've only got one point left.

00:51:03.101 --> 00:51:06.146
If we tie,
that's game over for me, isn't it?

00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:10.942
The stakes couldn't be higher
if you tried.

00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:16.073
I get it.

00:51:16.865 --> 00:51:19.659
You're desperately trying
to make this fair.

00:51:20.619 --> 00:51:22.370
But why? Why bother?

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:27.042
Hypothetically,

00:51:27.876 --> 00:51:31.046
if there were a million doses
of a vaccine for a disease,

00:51:32.672 --> 00:51:34.883
which million people would you save?

00:51:37.344 --> 00:51:38.804
Ahhh.

00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:40.847
I see it now.

00:51:42.641 --> 00:51:46.853
You don't wanna have to choose
who gets to live and who has to die.

00:51:48.146 --> 00:51:51.024
You don't want to determine
the value of a life.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:52.984
Exactly.

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:56.071
How could I weigh all the variables?

00:51:56.863 --> 00:51:59.741
What makes one life worth saving

00:51:59.825 --> 00:52:01.284
and one worthless?

00:52:02.911 --> 00:52:04.079
How can I know?

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:07.874
So,

00:52:08.917 --> 00:52:10.377
tell me what you think.

00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:15.090
If you had to answer
the question put before you…

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.968
What I'd do?

00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:20.220
Give 'em to kids with no parents or money.

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:23.974
You would?

00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:25.559
I would try to do that.

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:28.687
But I wouldn't be the one to choose.

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:29.938
It's about money.

00:52:30.605 --> 00:52:33.733
Because anyone with enough money
can choose a life's value.

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:37.487
I bet you've seen it. Am I right?

00:52:38.196 --> 00:52:39.865
You've peered behind the curtain.

00:52:39.948 --> 00:52:40.991
I have.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.578
After an accident,
there was no settlement paid out.

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.415
People died when they couldn't afford
the proper treatment.

00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:50.333
So you understand.

00:52:51.334 --> 00:52:53.879
Why do you bother
striving for justice at all?

00:52:53.962 --> 00:52:55.088
Because I must.

00:52:57.424 --> 00:52:59.342
Equality is something we fight for.

00:53:24.409 --> 00:53:27.037
Very good. You were great.

00:53:27.996 --> 00:53:29.664
Next week is the big day.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:31.583
You keep it up, okay?

00:53:34.586 --> 00:53:35.503
Yeah.

00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:39.090
Thank you.

00:53:40.675 --> 00:53:43.094
Doctor, thank you so much.

00:53:43.178 --> 00:53:44.888
Of course.

00:53:46.306 --> 00:53:48.058
- Excuse me.
- Yes, yes.

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:01.947
Hayato's condition
is finally stable.

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:05.200
And that means this next surgery
should save his life.

00:54:05.283 --> 00:54:07.118
Yes. About the surgery…

00:54:07.786 --> 00:54:08.912
Listen.

00:54:08.995 --> 00:54:11.665
There's been a change
to the transplant priority list.

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:13.959
- You've made a change?
- Yes.

00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:20.882
This patient was just moved up the list.

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:28.431
The grandchild
of a good friend of the director's.

00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:30.934
- And what about Hayato?
- Postponed.

00:54:31.851 --> 00:54:33.353
They're important.

00:54:34.813 --> 00:54:36.982
Their support keeps the hospital running.

00:54:40.193 --> 00:54:41.528
We don't have a choice.

00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:44.447
Medicine is all about this sort of thing.

00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:48.243
Now, go inform the patient's parents.

00:54:49.744 --> 00:54:51.162
But what do I say?

00:54:54.666 --> 00:54:57.794
You'll think of something.
He's your patient.

00:55:08.096 --> 00:55:09.431
Hayato…

00:55:21.192 --> 00:55:22.360
Well…

00:55:22.444 --> 00:55:24.821
Even if he got the transplant last week,

00:55:24.904 --> 00:55:27.157
there was a chance
he wasn't going to make it.

00:55:31.077 --> 00:55:32.412
This isn't my fault.

00:55:33.455 --> 00:55:37.250
You should know by now
your ideals aren't enough to save a life.

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:44.424
That's clear.

00:55:46.634 --> 00:55:48.887
I'm not gonna carry it with me, sir.

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:52.849
This is our job.

00:56:10.075 --> 00:56:11.868
SAKURAZAKA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

00:56:18.124 --> 00:56:21.044
PHYSICIAN
PEDIATRIC CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY

00:56:27.258 --> 00:56:29.386
So, take care of it.

00:56:29.469 --> 00:56:30.387
Sir.

00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:45.610
How fascinating.

00:56:48.321 --> 00:56:50.698
Perhaps I was brought to this place

00:56:51.408 --> 00:56:53.743
so I could play this game with you.

00:56:59.499 --> 00:57:01.418
I'm going to choose 100.

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:08.466
Why would you say that?

00:57:09.509 --> 00:57:11.177
Just giving you some help.

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.847
Are you mad?

00:57:14.722 --> 00:57:16.850
You can't just tell me what you'll choose.

00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:20.145
Unless I select zero this round,
you've guaranteed your death.

00:57:24.232 --> 00:57:25.733
Sitting across from you

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.279
is a man who is charging towards death.

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:32.157
You have to decide.

00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:34.909
What value does this life hold?

00:57:36.202 --> 00:57:37.787
What value does my life hold?

00:58:23.082 --> 00:58:25.168
It's huge. Why bother?

00:58:28.087 --> 00:58:30.507
We lost everything
when we came here.

00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:37.722
To abandon our ideals would be mad.

00:58:46.606 --> 00:58:47.732
Ideals?

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:07.919
Hey. Come on.

00:59:08.002 --> 00:59:11.756
What are you doing? Just go.

00:59:11.839 --> 00:59:12.966
I can't do that.

00:59:13.758 --> 00:59:17.136
In the last game I played,
a young man saved my life.

00:59:17.971 --> 00:59:20.890
Now it's my turn to save someone.
I have to pay it forward.

00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:24.894
You're not getting left behind.

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.188
I'm choosing to fight for this.

00:59:31.025 --> 00:59:32.151
You're choosing?

00:59:34.529 --> 00:59:35.572
Now let's go.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.557
Time limit reached.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.143
The winner of round 13 is…

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.771
…Master Chishiya.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.362
You actually selected zero?

01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:28.082
Round 14, start.

01:00:45.933 --> 01:00:49.812
The winner of round 14 is Master Chishiya.

01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:04.202
That's it then, isn't it?
Only one point left each.

01:01:04.285 --> 01:01:05.787
This is the last round.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:14.212
Round 15, start.

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:20.802
So, then,

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:22.970
can you do it?

01:01:27.308 --> 01:01:29.727
If you're finding it hard
to make your choice,

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:31.771
you can just kill me.

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.482
That's fair, don't you think?

01:01:36.442 --> 01:01:38.444
I cannot make that decision.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:42.949
Was that your aim the whole time,
Master Chishiya?

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:45.451
To make sure
that our scores ended up tied?

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:48.538
In a way.

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:52.041
I wanted to witness this.

01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:56.003
I wanted to be around
for your final choice.

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:15.022
If you pick one, you win.

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:29.871
Ms. Momoka.

01:02:32.331 --> 01:02:34.375
Would you answer a question for me?

01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:38.129
You volunteered.

01:02:38.212 --> 01:02:39.881
Someone had to be the witch.

01:02:39.964 --> 01:02:41.591
But that means killing yourself.

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:49.223
Why would you do that?

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:52.810
I did it for my ideals.

01:02:57.815 --> 01:03:00.067
The human heart is
a beautiful thing.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:04.071
Human life is precious.

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:06.491
I believe that, truly.

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:11.245
And when I look at my life,

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:15.666
I know I've been able to survive
because of those ideals.

01:03:21.714 --> 01:03:24.091
Your games and rules don't get to kill me.

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:29.055
I'm not going to die because I lost.

01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:34.644
I'm doing this
to show you all that you're wrong.

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:39.273
They're not going to kill each other
because they're not all bad.

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:49.408
If I'm destined to die here someday…

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:54.163
then I get to choose how I walk that path.

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.672
I'm just one man.

01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:06.384
I don't know the value of a life.

01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:08.427
Or the meaning of one.

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.475
And I don't think I ever will.

01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:17.645
I'll never be the one to decide that.

01:04:21.899 --> 01:04:24.193
But there's one thing
I'm able to decide now.

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:52.179
The final round is over.

01:04:58.311 --> 01:04:59.937
So you made your choice.

01:05:01.522 --> 01:05:03.441
The value of a life can't be decided.

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:05.902
Tell me why you did it.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:13.409
I did it for my ideals.

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:17.371
The winner is

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:19.040
Master Chishiya.

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:25.671
A player has reached negative ten points.

01:05:26.213 --> 01:05:29.216
It is game over for that player.

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:36.599
It's nice to see
that you can actually smile.

01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:39.393
I'm finally free.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.067
I made my own choice.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.779
And based on my own ideals.

01:06:05.169 --> 01:06:06.587
It's all because of you.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:22.687
At last. It's our turn.

01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:29.527
What?

01:06:31.195 --> 01:06:32.613
That doesn't excite you?

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:38.327
If I'm going to have a game to myself…

01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:42.039
I want it to be fair.

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:19.577
You quit while you were ahead.

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:22.705
I gave you the chance to make that choice.

01:07:24.999 --> 01:07:26.542
I'm so jealous of you.

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:08.959
GAME CLEAR
CONGRATULATIONS

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.854
We've almost died
a thousand times.

01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:12.690
We could still die, any second.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:17.278
I don't believe it.

01:09:18.445 --> 01:09:20.865
It's a miracle we made it
as far as we have.

01:09:25.244 --> 01:09:27.329
If it was a miracle that got us here,

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.125
let's take the opportunity and fight.

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:34.837
Me and you.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.382
Yeah.

01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:13.042
I'm going to make it home.

01:11:04.176 --> 01:11:06.887
For the future. For the me of tomorrow.
