00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.144
(Lee Joo Young)

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:21.855
(Ji Seung Hyun)

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:31.932
(Koo Jun Hoe)

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.810
(Mom)

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:50.050
(No Mercy)

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.053
(All characters, organizations, groups,)

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.054
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:28.091
(No Mercy)

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:36.363
You're nothing but a parasite
leaching off Koreans.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.966
And you think they'd let me in?

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:42.669
Do I look like a joke to you?

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.439
You think it's funny
that I'm desperate to survive?

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:51.078
Is it funny to you, seeing me
fighting for my life in the gutter?

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:55.782
You psycho jerk!

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.020
(Director jerk)

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.955
You psycho jerk.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.293
Hello?

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.227
Hey.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.663
Run a quick errand for me
on your way here.

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:10.664
What?

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:11.999
What now?

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.767
You know where Olim Telecom is, right?

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.136
Go there and pick up some stuff.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.406
What stuff?

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:20.874
Just filming props.

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.810
We'll load it straight into the car,
so head out now.

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.045
I'll pay you when you're here.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.849
You're really going to pay me today,
right?

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:35.355
Son of a bitch.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:39.660
Son of a bitch.

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.196
You psycho jerk.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:44.765
You psycho jerk.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.301
You psycho jerk!

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:56.376
Let's go.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.482
(The Woman from Yanbian)

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.520
Dad, enjoy the show.

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:10.390
Mom.

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:18.832
You scared me.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.403
(Notice of electric service termination)

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.173
What are you doing here?

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.109
My phone had no signal,
so I couldn't call.

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.377
Why isn't your phone getting a signal?

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.012
Give me your phone.

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:34.948
Please, don't bother
and worry about yourself.

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:36.750
Why are you going in?
I have to head out.

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:41.555
My goodness, look at this mess.

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.690
Jeez.

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:46.727
You've been messing around
with this acting stuff.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:47.828
Unbelievable.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:55.202
Are you still on sleeping pills?

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:56.069
Wait.

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:58.839
These are just vitamins. I stopped.

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:59.973
Like hell you stopped.

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.742
You think I'm a fool?

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:03.510
Good grief.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:07.014
I was out of my mind to let you
drop out of a perfectly good college...

00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:10.884
just because you complained
it wasn't for you. Who else can I blame?

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:13.187
If you keep living like this
with those sleeping pills,

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:15.822
your life is going to go down the drain
before you know it, understand?

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:16.990
Mom.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.393
Did I ever ask you
to approve of my acting?

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:21.962
Besides,

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.098
I've got a show tonight.

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:30.504
Have you ever come to see
your daughter perform, even once?

00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:32.973
You threw away that bright future
ahead of you...

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:34.174
and now live like this.
That's why I'm telling you this.

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:35.776
Bright future? Don't make me laugh.

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:39.780
And what kind of life are you living, Mom?

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:44.751
Your life
without ever having a dream is...

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.522
more pathetic than mine.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:49.990
You know that?

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:25.926
(Director jerk)

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:28.629
The costume team will drop the clothes off
in Dongmyo.

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.330
Bring a bag with you, something sturdy.

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.299
You're really going to pay me
this time, right?

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:35.702
Today's tough.

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:38.338
I just paid rent,
and I've got nothing left.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.506
I'll pay you
when the money comes in later.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.241
I got fooled again.

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:53.787
Then I can't just hand it over to you
for free.

00:05:55.322 --> 00:05:59.193
(Phone repair, used phones)

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:00.694
What kind of phone do you want?

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.296
- Anything's fine.
- Anything?

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:03.830
All right then.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.665
Excuse me.

00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:08.836
I left it there. Just take it.

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:13.540
Ta-da.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.709
It's a prepaid plan, okay?

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.545
Look, let me explain.

00:06:19.012 --> 00:06:21.582
Here's prepaid 350,

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:23.417
and prepaid 450.
If you use it on H or G network...

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:26.386
A criminal ring
running a voice phishing scam...

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.323
based in a Shandong apartment
has been caught by police.

00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:32.492
According to the voice phishing crime unit
at the Seongan Police Agency,

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:35.596
they were mostly people in their 20s
and 30s struggling to find job,

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:38.699
who fell for job ads about easy money...

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.567
and ended up joining the scheme.

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:45.973
Let's verify
your personal information.

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:46.874
Names?

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:48.575
Ye Won Joo.

00:06:48.876 --> 00:06:49.877
Park Dae Hee.

00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:50.911
Kang Han Gu.

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:51.979
Min Sang Gi.

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.414
You all sound amazing.

00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:57.317
Did you all take vocal lessons
together somewhere?

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.654
If so, tell me.
I might have to check it out too.

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:03.223
What's so funny? I'm serious.

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:07.261
I'm actually almost perfect,

00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:08.428
except for one flaw.

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:10.330
What is it?

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.599
Maybe it's my voice,

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:14.334
but no matter how many times
I tell them to stop,

00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:16.570
they just won't listen.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.705
So that's on me, right?

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.345
I see.

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:34.454
Nice to see you again, Detective.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:37.157
It's not like you're performing
at some annual idol group event.

00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:39.560
So, is this a year-end greeting?

00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:41.528
It's a New Year's greeting.

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:44.798
Detective. Happy New Year.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:45.933
May you live a long life with illness,

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:48.202
no, I mean, a long life in good health.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:51.705
Detective Park.

00:07:57.845 --> 00:07:59.780
I just got some intel.

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:02.149
The Ilseong clan are in Korea.

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:04.718
You mean Team Leader Park Min Su
from Daehwan Loan Services?

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:05.786
Exactly.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:07.721
Looks like the ringleader...

00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:11.525
has sneaked in himself
because of the drug deal.

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:17.431
Wait, he came himself,
without sending his underlings?

00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:20.100
So they must have some connection.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.169
For some reason, the Chinese police...

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:24.505
won't cooperate much regarding them.

00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:27.908
No matter how much we bribe
and sweet-talk them.

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:29.209
And yet,

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:31.845
they just decided to come to Korea?

00:08:34.047 --> 00:08:35.315
What did the higher-ups say?

00:08:36.884 --> 00:08:37.985
They say leave them alone.

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:40.521
What?

00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:43.991
Apparently, stirring the hornet's nest
won't do any good.

00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:45.959
They're tied to some political big shot.

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:47.961
That's not how it should be.

00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:49.630
If they have political connections,

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.698
their crimes get erased?

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.166
Just leave them alone.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.203
This isn't a request.
It's an order from above.

00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:57.171
Still...

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:01.942
Fine.

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:04.211
What good comes from
getting on the higher-ups' bad side?

00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.713
They've never liked me anyway.

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:07.548
Hey.

00:09:07.548 --> 00:09:09.650
You graduated from the police academy.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.852
Why are you always acting out?

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.288
I'll just...

00:09:14.922 --> 00:09:16.123
step out for a smoke.

00:09:16.123 --> 00:09:18.692
Anyway, you need to stay put this time.
Got it?

00:09:18.692 --> 00:09:19.693
Of course.

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:21.795
It's an order from above.

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:37.978
Hey, Jong Chan.

00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:40.747
Contact the traffic investigation unit
for me.

00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:42.749
Ma'am.

00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:46.753
It's so annoying.

00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:51.592
Just think about it.

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:53.594
Can't you do the math?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.730
No, I just need a SIM card.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.831
Give me the cheapest one.

00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:00.200
Listen up, ma'am.

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:03.904
You said you have a daughter in China.
Don't you call her?

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:05.439
Well...

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:07.941
Exactly. If you activate the device
and use the G network,

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:09.376
it's perfect.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.011
My goodness.

00:10:11.245 --> 00:10:12.746
Come on, ma'am.

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:15.382
Technically, giving more than
the official subsidy is illegal,

00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:16.850
but I'll do it on the side for you.

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:19.019
I'm even knocking $130 off the device...

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:21.522
by $130 myself.

00:10:21.522 --> 00:10:23.891
I'll take care of it all, okay?

00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:25.259
Paying in full, okay?

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:28.195
Mom.

00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:34.168
I looked everywhere, but you weren't home.

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:37.337
I asked the uncle at the restaurant,
and he didn't know either.

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:41.808
And here you are,
getting played by this low-level punk?

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:43.610
What?

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.846
Weren't you here
to pick up some movie props earlier?

00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:48.782
Ma'am.

00:10:50.184 --> 00:10:51.618
Is she really your daughter?

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:54.621
Just because someone picks up props
doesn't mean they're Korean.

00:10:56.557 --> 00:10:57.558
Mom.

00:10:57.558 --> 00:11:00.761
I didn't tell you so I could surprise you.
Surprised?

00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:04.131
Gosh, Mom.

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:07.701
I've missed you so much.

00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:11.338
Hong Hwa. You came to see me.

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:14.842
Look at you.

00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:17.744
With that grumpy face of yours,

00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:20.514
how's anyone supposed to like you?

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:24.918
Stop lying.
Just give her the cheapest SIM card.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.421
Chop-chop.

00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:29.356
Chop-chop.

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:37.097
Well then.

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:39.533
Thank you so much.

00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:45.506
I never thought I'd get help
from another Chinese-Korean.

00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:47.074
Where are you from?

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:49.142
I'm from Longjing.

00:11:50.744 --> 00:11:51.845
I'm from Gyeongsang-do.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:54.414
Gyeongsang-do?

00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:10.697
You scared me.

00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:20.941
Thank you.

00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:25.078
Tell your daughter to treat her mom well.

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:32.119
Seongsu Vocational High School.

00:12:33.887 --> 00:12:36.890
Hong Hwa is my son.

00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:40.527
I'm living with my son.

00:12:57.044 --> 00:12:59.913
(Olim Telecom)

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.291
(The Woman from Yanbian)

00:13:34.615 --> 00:13:38.218
(So Min Soup and Rice)

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:41.855
Can I spend this Christmas...

00:13:41.855 --> 00:13:44.958
with a beautiful lady from Yanbian?

00:13:45.626 --> 00:13:46.460
Dad.

00:13:47.828 --> 00:13:51.064
Wait, the show is at 6 p.m.
It's coming up soon.

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:54.835
Come and have a hearty soup
before you go.

00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:57.137
I can't, I have rehearsal,
I have to go.

00:13:57.638 --> 00:13:58.805
I guess there's nothing I can do.

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:00.974
I was going to host an actor
for a meal after a long time...

00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:04.211
and get a signature to display
at the restaurant.

00:14:05.412 --> 00:14:06.547
Well then,

00:14:06.547 --> 00:14:08.815
Break a leg, superstar.

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:10.017
Stop it.

00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:12.019
- Bye.
- All right.

00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:16.290
Dad, you don't have to come
if you're busy.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.157
Hey.

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:20.761
You can just ask your mom and dad
to come to your show.

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:23.030
See you later, sweetie.

00:14:23.497 --> 00:14:25.265
- You got this!
- I got this!

00:14:25.566 --> 00:14:26.533
I'm off now.

00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:34.174
For the stabbing scene,

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:36.310
should we adjust the timing again?

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.579
The director is looking for you,
like, right now.

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:39.680
Is something going on?

00:14:40.347 --> 00:14:41.615
Not really.

00:14:42.082 --> 00:14:44.518
Then why's he freaking out again?

00:14:44.518 --> 00:14:47.087
Hye Dam, you know what they say?

00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:50.624
Even a nobleman's servant won't work...

00:14:50.624 --> 00:14:51.859
if they won't get paid.

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:56.096
Lee Seung Tae is always like that,
nothing new.

00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:57.064
Really now?

00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:00.834
Look over there, buddy.

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:01.735
Yes, ma'am.

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.171
Let me know what you'd like to eat,
I'll bring it right to you.

00:15:04.171 --> 00:15:08.175
She's collecting what she's owed,
running errands for Lee Seung Tae's wife.

00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:10.277
And look over there.

00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:12.746
His situation is a bit better.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.581
At least, he landed a small role...

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:16.850
in the crime film the director's making.

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:19.186
But guess what?

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.221
No pay whatsoever.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.892
Everyone's scrambling to get
even a bit of the money he swindled.

00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:26.527
I'm also collecting the money he owes me.

00:15:27.027 --> 00:15:27.828
What?

00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:29.763
I stole the bag today.

00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:32.232
I'm going to sell everything in the bag.

00:15:32.733 --> 00:15:33.600
What?

00:15:35.836 --> 00:15:37.771
I wondered why you've been quiet
these days.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:41.275
What are you going to do?
That's theft.

00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:43.744
What do you mean?
Isn't what he did to us the same thing?

00:15:43.744 --> 00:15:45.078
So Min.

00:15:45.746 --> 00:15:47.080
Where's Ha So Min?

00:15:55.222 --> 00:15:56.757
Where's this bitch?

00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:58.458
Maybe she's rehearsing?

00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.860
What's the matter?

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.428
I told that crazy bitch

00:16:02.095 --> 00:16:04.298
to pick up something,
and she stashed them somewhere.

00:16:04.932 --> 00:16:06.366
You're finished today.

00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:10.003
Come back safely before the show.

00:16:10.003 --> 00:16:11.605
No, what did I do wrong?

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:13.707
You should debut first.

00:16:14.174 --> 00:16:17.611
Just thinking about you two going at it,
my head is shaking.

00:16:17.911 --> 00:16:18.745
Grab it.

00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:20.314
Then today,

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.883
- it's a solid magnitude eight.
- Come on, So Min.

00:16:22.883 --> 00:16:25.819
Don't push me. Why do I have to go?

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:27.921
- Get out.
- I'm not going.

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:34.962
- Gyu Jong.
- Yes, sir.

00:16:35.295 --> 00:16:38.298
Do you know why this tiny thing
can be useful?

00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:39.833
I don't know, sir.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.035
It shows people at their lowest.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.206
This tiny powder can make
the clever idiot,

00:16:47.508 --> 00:16:50.344
and good people turn into scum,

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:51.979
right into criminals.

00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:56.617
Jeez.

00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:06.059
I can't stay away from Korea
because I miss this smell.

00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:41.195
The 6 p.m. show is starting now.

00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:43.330
Let me check your tickets on this side.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.264
Hello?

00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:47.167
When are you coming?
The show's starting now.

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:49.803
Why are you being so annoying?

00:17:49.803 --> 00:17:51.205
Come on.

00:17:51.205 --> 00:17:53.907
Who cares about the bouquet?
It's the show that matters.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:57.244
It would've been great
if you bought it ahead of time.

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:00.347
Hello?

00:18:00.814 --> 00:18:03.584
Once the show starts, you can’t get in.

00:18:03.584 --> 00:18:05.018
So you need to hurry.

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:07.688
What are you saying?

00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:10.924
It keeps acting up.

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.926
Let's see. Let's go.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.995
(Price $70)

00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:16.263
(Price $60)

00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:17.831
Are you looking
for any particular flowers?

00:18:19.466 --> 00:18:23.036
I'm just looking for something
for my daughter.

00:18:23.237 --> 00:18:24.872
Is it for her birthday?

00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:26.240
No, it's not.

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.609
Let me pick something for you.

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:30.544
What's the occasion?

00:18:31.678 --> 00:18:34.114
My daughter's performing in a play.

00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:37.384
She's playing the lead.

00:18:37.384 --> 00:18:40.120
Your daughter's an actress?

00:18:40.988 --> 00:18:44.458
If she takes after you,
no wonder she's got the lead role.

00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:45.692
My goodness.

00:18:48.495 --> 00:18:50.063
Wow.

00:18:50.531 --> 00:18:52.132
Are these camilias?

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:55.702
So beautiful.

00:18:55.702 --> 00:18:57.638
They're very popular in winter.

00:18:58.539 --> 00:19:00.007
Want me to make this into a bouquet?

00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:02.809
Yes, one please.

00:19:07.014 --> 00:19:08.415
(Police checkpoint)

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:11.652
You idiot, can't you drive better?

00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:13.854
- Well, sir.
- What?

00:19:13.854 --> 00:19:16.190
There’s a police checkpoint ahead.

00:19:16.623 --> 00:19:17.424
What?

00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:20.994
Damn it.

00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:23.830
What are you doing? Hit the gas.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.465
Cops are everywhere.

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:41.248
Shit, then get out.

00:19:41.248 --> 00:19:42.082
Sorry?

00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:45.519
Go distract them. Move aside.

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:46.420
What about me?

00:19:46.987 --> 00:19:47.888
Come over here.

00:19:48.322 --> 00:19:51.158
You idiot, are you counting on me
to save you?

00:19:51.158 --> 00:19:54.328
I said get out!

00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:09.710
Stop the car.

00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:12.646
Stand the car now!

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.648
Damn it.

00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:52.386
Stupid bastards.

00:20:57.891 --> 00:20:59.893
Doors close in one minute.

00:21:08.602 --> 00:21:11.271
The show is starting.
Hurry and take your seats.

00:21:15.075 --> 00:21:16.977
She's unbelievable.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.018
I'm running late.

00:21:28.488 --> 00:21:29.289
Hello?

00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:32.960
Why's this acting up again?

00:21:34.328 --> 00:21:36.430
I'm already late.

00:21:38.832 --> 00:21:39.800
It's okay.

00:21:41.568 --> 00:21:42.836
I'm right here.

00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:53.614
Chang Ok, you got citizenship
thanks to me,

00:21:54.648 --> 00:21:55.616
have a baby,

00:21:56.683 --> 00:21:57.751
stay fed,

00:21:58.318 --> 00:21:59.920
and even have a house.

00:22:00.854 --> 00:22:01.822
But...

00:22:02.356 --> 00:22:04.091
what's with all the complaints?

00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:07.861
I give you money regularly,
yet you still act like a bitch!

00:22:11.064 --> 00:22:11.999
Bitch?

00:22:20.874 --> 00:22:22.609
I'm late.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:23.944
My goodness.

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:29.149
What the heck?
This is unbelievable.

00:22:29.483 --> 00:22:31.518
What's wrong with this?

00:22:31.785 --> 00:22:33.887
Did I ever have something like that
to begin with?

00:22:35.189 --> 00:22:36.023
A house,

00:22:37.024 --> 00:22:37.925
family,

00:22:38.992 --> 00:22:39.860
and country.

00:22:42.262 --> 00:22:44.965
When did I ever have any of that?

00:22:45.499 --> 00:22:46.366
What?

00:22:46.767 --> 00:22:48.602
Let's see if that's true.

00:22:54.675 --> 00:22:56.777
You psycho jerk!

00:22:59.213 --> 00:23:01.682
That bastard, this thing is pricey.

00:23:50.697 --> 00:23:54.401
What the hell? I have no time for this.

00:24:02.242 --> 00:24:03.110
Hey.

00:24:05.379 --> 00:24:06.580
Damn it.

00:24:07.381 --> 00:24:08.815
I've got bad luck all over me.

00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:19.426
Damn it.

00:24:33.173 --> 00:24:34.441
Damn it.

00:24:37.044 --> 00:24:38.145
That scared the hell out of me!

00:24:47.387 --> 00:24:48.789
My daughter...

00:24:53.193 --> 00:24:56.563
got her first lead role.

00:24:59.299 --> 00:25:00.400
I...

00:25:01.134 --> 00:25:03.537
I have to go.

00:25:05.105 --> 00:25:07.341
I have to be there.

00:25:07.975 --> 00:25:09.309
Crap.

00:25:10.644 --> 00:25:13.580
What kind of bullshit is that?
What does that have to do with me?

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.184
Please.

00:25:18.151 --> 00:25:19.186
Hold on.

00:25:20.621 --> 00:25:21.455
Lady.

00:25:22.289 --> 00:25:24.024
Your voice is quite convincing.

00:25:24.024 --> 00:25:24.992
Right?

00:25:27.594 --> 00:25:28.729
Awesome!

00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:40.207
Perfect acting!

00:26:08.202 --> 00:26:09.736
Damn, she's heavy.

00:26:20.214 --> 00:26:22.115
Lady, get some rest.

00:26:31.391 --> 00:26:34.895
(The Woman from Yanbian)

00:26:44.538 --> 00:26:45.772
Ta-da.

00:26:45.772 --> 00:26:46.740
What?

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.509
I'm officially a dad of an actress now.

00:26:48.942 --> 00:26:51.545
I’m the dad
with the most gorgeous daughter.

00:26:51.545 --> 00:26:53.947
- I'm embarrassed. Stop it.
- Why?

00:26:58.752 --> 00:27:01.488
I came with your mom,

00:27:01.488 --> 00:27:02.589
but in the middle...

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.358
Hang on. Let me call her.

00:27:04.858 --> 00:27:07.761
How far has she gone?

00:27:12.466 --> 00:27:13.967
Why isn't she picking up?

00:27:44.665 --> 00:27:45.799
Answer the phone.

00:27:47.868 --> 00:27:48.902
Never mind.

00:27:50.571 --> 00:27:52.973
I'm telling you.
She went to buy some flowers.

00:27:53.207 --> 00:27:55.242
She may sound cold,

00:27:55.542 --> 00:27:57.678
but she's been dying to see you on stage.

00:27:57.678 --> 00:28:00.047
She always talks about you to customers
at our shop.

00:28:00.347 --> 00:28:01.915
She just can't stop talking about you,

00:28:01.915 --> 00:28:04.985
so I have to stop her all the time.

00:28:04.985 --> 00:28:05.886
Dad.

00:28:06.253 --> 00:28:07.087
What?

00:28:08.856 --> 00:28:09.823
Don't try so hard.

00:28:10.424 --> 00:28:12.159
No, it's not that. It's true.

00:28:12.893 --> 00:28:14.461
You aren't going? I'm hungry.

00:28:15.662 --> 00:28:16.663
Wait.

00:28:16.964 --> 00:28:18.966
Mom will be here soon.
Let's just wait a bit.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.602
- If you don't want to, I'll just go.
- Wait.

00:28:24.171 --> 00:28:25.372
Seriously.

00:28:37.784 --> 00:28:41.054
Take care of the car
and go fetch Gyu Jong.

00:28:41.622 --> 00:28:43.056
If the cops catch him,
it's going to be a headache.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:44.424
Yes, sir.

00:28:44.424 --> 00:28:46.426
I almost forgot.

00:28:55.869 --> 00:28:57.738
Lady, it's time to wake up.

00:29:01.542 --> 00:29:02.776
Wake up.

All clear.

00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:15.782
Look here.

00:30:16.116 --> 00:30:18.785
Press it three times quickly.

00:30:18.785 --> 00:30:20.621
- Here, three times.
- Three times.

00:30:20.854 --> 00:30:21.855
1, 2, 3.

There we go.

00:30:23.857 --> 00:30:24.892
- Let's see.
- That worked.

00:30:25.726 --> 00:30:27.494
See, the SOS alert gets sent to me.

00:30:28.028 --> 00:30:29.630
That's amazing.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:30.898
Keep this in mind...

00:30:30.898 --> 00:30:33.133
and in an emergency, press it
quickly three times.

00:30:33.133 --> 00:30:34.468
Okay.

Excuse me.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.831
- No, thanks.
- Please take a look at this.

00:31:05.399 --> 00:31:06.567
Could you please take a look at this?

00:31:09.636 --> 00:31:11.205
- No, thanks.
- Excuse me.

00:31:15.843 --> 00:31:16.910
Can you take a look at this?

00:31:18.345 --> 00:31:19.179
Hello?

Hello?

00:31:21.648 --> 00:31:22.749
Go ahead, sir.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.119
I saw the person you're looking for.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.956
You saw my wife? Where?

00:31:28.956 --> 00:31:32.092
It'd be no fun
if I just told you for free.

00:31:32.092 --> 00:31:33.360
Come to where I am.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.996
Yes, sir. I'll be right there.
Where is that?

00:31:35.996 --> 00:31:36.830

Hello?

00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:46.206
Why would you just hang up like that?
They might have really seen her.

00:31:46.206 --> 00:31:48.408
It's already been a week
since she disappeared.

00:31:49.109 --> 00:31:50.043
Yet...

00:31:50.677 --> 00:31:52.412
why do you keep falling for it?

This one might actually be real.

00:31:58.151 --> 00:32:01.722
Don't just believe it
unless you actually hear Mom's voice.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.958
Are there any flyers left?

00:32:06.894 --> 00:32:08.762
Why? What's going on?

00:32:12.199 --> 00:32:13.066
I'm sorry.

- Hye Dam.
- Yes?

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:20.807
Okay.

00:32:37.491 --> 00:32:41.595
She was last seen
at the flower shop, right?

00:32:41.595 --> 00:32:44.798
We checked the cars parked nearby,

00:32:44.798 --> 00:32:47.267
but the dashcams were off.

00:32:47.267 --> 00:32:48.468
What about location tracking?

00:32:48.836 --> 00:32:52.573
Ms. Kim Mi Yang is listed as a runaway,

00:32:52.806 --> 00:32:54.975
so there's no legal ground to track her.

00:32:55.275 --> 00:32:56.143
For me...

For her daughter, she bought flowers.

And yet she's considered a runaway?

00:33:05.118 --> 00:33:07.154
That's what the law says.

00:33:07.487 --> 00:33:08.288
That's the law.

00:33:08.689 --> 00:33:11.959

This time, you used a DUI checkpoint
as an excuse to head to the scene?

You crazy idiot!

I swear I genuinely went out to help.

00:33:29.009 --> 00:33:30.310
How was I supposed to know...

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.346
the ringleader would pop up...

00:33:32.346 --> 00:33:33.914
out of nowhere?

You think I don’t know you?

00:33:36.183 --> 00:33:39.319
The commissioner’s going ballistic
about this.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.122
I told you not to poke the hornet’s nest.

Calm down
and tell me exactly what happened.

00:35:00.501 --> 00:35:01.435
Hit-and-run?

I'm the hit-and-run driver.

I'm sorry about that.

00:35:07.274 --> 00:35:09.743
I ran over your wife with my car.

00:35:10.911 --> 00:35:12.279
Where are you?

00:35:12.279 --> 00:35:13.413
Is she hurt badly?

00:35:14.081 --> 00:35:15.949
I'll be right there. Where is she?

Seeing someone dying...

00:35:21.855 --> 00:35:24.091
made me feel terrible.

00:35:25.692 --> 00:35:28.829
But I don't want to spend my money
to take her to the hospital.

00:35:29.196 --> 00:35:30.030
Why?

00:35:30.497 --> 00:35:32.199
Because there was nobody around.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.369

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:44.077
Are you sure...

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:48.315
Are you sure she's my wife?

How did that happen?

00:36:05.032 --> 00:36:08.135
I was buying flowers

Right, just to be safe,

00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:18.011
what happens if you call the police?

00:36:45.572 --> 00:36:46.773
Please, sir.

00:36:47.207 --> 00:36:49.176
I swear

00:36:49.176 --> 00:36:51.979
I will never call the police, not ever.
Please...

00:36:53.847 --> 00:36:55.082
just let my wife...

00:36:56.250 --> 00:37:00.554
come home alive. I beg you, sir.

00:37:01.788 --> 00:37:03.390
Okay, now we're talking.

00:37:04.391 --> 00:37:06.093
So what's your offer?

00:37:15.002 --> 00:37:16.770
We haven't seen each other
since college, right?

00:37:19.373 --> 00:37:22.609
I still remember when we were training
at the Police Academy,

00:37:22.609 --> 00:37:24.778
you were the best at the fitness test
among the freshmen.

When you suddenly dropped out,

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.218
I was disappointed.

00:37:32.553 --> 00:37:34.087
Looks like you did become a cop.

00:37:35.422 --> 00:37:36.256
Yeah.

00:37:38.825 --> 00:37:40.294
Right, anyway,

00:37:41.295 --> 00:37:42.896
did something happen to your family?

00:37:46.466 --> 00:37:48.769
My mom disappeared.

00:37:49.937 --> 00:37:50.804
She disappeared?

00:37:51.805 --> 00:37:52.840
When?

00:37:53.407 --> 00:37:56.276
A week ago, near
Seongnae Industrial Complex Intersection.

00:37:57.177 --> 00:37:58.478

00:38:01.949 --> 00:38:03.116
When exactly was that?

00:38:03.684 --> 00:38:05.919
Around 6 p.m., she was caught on
the security camera...

00:38:05.919 --> 00:38:07.421
leaving a flower shop.

00:38:07.421 --> 00:38:08.455
A flower shop.

00:38:36.483 --> 00:38:37.551
Yes, hello?

00:38:37.551 --> 00:38:38.552
Yes, sir.

00:38:38.552 --> 00:38:40.153
Yes, I'm almost there.

00:38:40.387 --> 00:38:42.956
Right now? I'm out front of Saebit Bank.

00:38:42.956 --> 00:38:44.291
Why isn't it coming down?

00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:46.293
Yes, I'll come up right now.

00:38:51.231 --> 00:38:52.599
(My wife)

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.135
Hold on, I'm almost there.s

00:38:55.135 --> 00:38:56.203
Give me a moment.

00:38:59.006 --> 00:39:01.141
Hold on!

00:39:01.141 --> 00:39:03.510
Move as fast as you can...

00:39:04.144 --> 00:39:06.013
and get the OTP card first.

00:39:06.013 --> 00:39:09.116
If the money isn't in by 4:10 p.m.
like we agreed,

00:39:10.317 --> 00:39:12.619
we'll take care of your wife.

00:39:12.986 --> 00:39:14.855
Yes, understood.

00:39:16.523 --> 00:39:18.992
If you set the OTP limit to the max,

00:39:18.992 --> 00:39:21.695
you can send up to $100,000
per transaction and $500,000 a day.

00:39:22.396 --> 00:39:25.866
You haven’t made
any big transactions recently.

00:39:25.866 --> 00:39:28.368
Why do you want to raise the limit?

00:39:28.669 --> 00:39:29.703
For my wife.

00:39:29.703 --> 00:39:30.704
For my wife's surgery.

00:39:31.104 --> 00:39:35.209
Have you ever gotten a call from someone
pretending to be the prosecutor’s office,

00:39:35.209 --> 00:39:36.844
the police,
or the Financial Supervisory Service?

00:39:36.844 --> 00:39:38.078
No, I haven't.

00:39:38.078 --> 00:39:40.214
Did anyone ask you to withdraw money?

00:39:40.214 --> 00:39:42.082
No, it's nothing like that.

00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:45.252
I'm allowed to take out my own money!
I haven't done anything wrong.

00:39:46.153 --> 00:39:48.755
Why are you holding up
when I’ve got no time?

00:39:49.423 --> 00:39:51.725
I’m in a rush,
please process this quickly.

00:39:51.725 --> 00:39:53.126
Please, I'm begging you.

00:39:53.126 --> 00:39:56.230
(Saebit Bank)

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.332
($50,000 sent)

00:40:00.133 --> 00:40:02.736
(Enter OTP code)

00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:04.872
Hello?

00:40:05.138 --> 00:40:07.140
Yes, I just sent it.

00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:08.976
What do I do next?

00:40:08.976 --> 00:40:11.478
Wait at home until I call you back.

00:40:11.478 --> 00:40:12.412
Wait a second.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.948
What if you don't call me?

00:40:15.415 --> 00:40:17.217
What if my wife just disappears?

00:40:17.751 --> 00:40:18.952
Please promise me.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.623
Promise me you'll bring her back safe.

00:40:23.223 --> 00:40:26.593
Okay, I'll call you at 6 p.m. sharp.
Be ready to come out.

00:40:27.694 --> 00:40:28.962
Hello?

00:40:38.005 --> 00:40:39.339
(Missing Person)

00:40:39.339 --> 00:40:41.275
This lady bought the flower that day.

00:40:41.275 --> 00:40:42.176
Was it...

00:40:43.911 --> 00:40:44.745
this one?

00:40:48.048 --> 00:40:50.050
That's right, camellia leaves.

00:40:51.318 --> 00:40:53.987
She really loved this flower.

00:40:55.556 --> 00:40:57.291
You still haven't found her yet, right?

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.768
The car I was chasing...

00:41:08.769 --> 00:41:10.370
passed the crash site...

00:41:11.271 --> 00:41:13.140
and the time your mom walked there...

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.342
from the flower shop...

00:41:17.177 --> 00:41:18.745
pretty much line up.

00:41:20.113 --> 00:41:21.081
Then...

00:41:21.081 --> 00:41:23.784
There’s still nothing certain yet.

00:41:32.893 --> 00:41:35.062
(My wife)

00:41:36.163 --> 00:41:37.197
Hello?

00:41:37.197 --> 00:41:38.065
Honey.

00:41:38.899 --> 00:41:39.833
Honey.

00:41:40.334 --> 00:41:41.869
Are you almost here?

00:41:42.135 --> 00:41:43.770
I'll come pick you up. Where are you?

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:46.540
No, I can't get out of here.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.008
Forever.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.444
What?

00:41:51.778 --> 00:41:54.948
I had no idea you were this loaded.

00:41:54.948 --> 00:41:57.818
This gentleman will put it to good use.

00:42:13.033 --> 00:42:15.536
(Mom)

00:42:15.769 --> 00:42:18.372
Looks like they switched the caller ID
using a manipulator device.

00:42:18.906 --> 00:42:20.908
Tell your dad if you get him on the line.

00:42:21.575 --> 00:42:24.211
Tell him never to pick up calls
coming from your mom's number.

00:42:24.511 --> 00:42:25.979
Let's hurry home first.

00:42:29.917 --> 00:42:32.686
I wanted to hear our daughter's voice
one last time.

00:42:32.686 --> 00:42:33.754
I guess I can't.

00:42:33.987 --> 00:42:35.022
Who are you?

00:42:35.956 --> 00:42:36.924
Me.

00:42:37.257 --> 00:42:38.358
It's me, honey.

00:42:41.028 --> 00:42:44.464
This deep-voice thing is
pretty impressive.

00:42:44.464 --> 00:42:46.233
Things are sure getting easier these days.

00:42:46.233 --> 00:42:48.235
You fraud.

00:42:49.203 --> 00:42:51.071
Where's my wife?

00:42:51.939 --> 00:42:54.508
Beats me. Where would she be by now?

00:42:54.508 --> 00:42:56.543
You bastard!

00:42:57.044 --> 00:43:01.014
I'll have you thrown in jail, you bastard!

00:43:01.014 --> 00:43:03.884
I think you're the one
who's going to hear that now.

00:43:04.418 --> 00:43:05.919
From now on,

00:43:06.386 --> 00:43:08.655
a flood of lawsuits is coming your way.

00:43:08.655 --> 00:43:10.424
(Ha Hyun Jin's transaction history)

00:43:15.662 --> 00:43:18.265
(Saebit Bank account activity)

00:43:20.834 --> 00:43:21.902
What is this?

00:43:21.902 --> 00:43:23.704
(Saebit Bank account activity)

00:43:26.473 --> 00:43:27.608
And this is...

00:43:28.408 --> 00:43:30.444
a little gift from me...

00:43:30.811 --> 00:43:32.946
as thanks for spending
such a huge amount of money.

00:43:33.247 --> 00:43:34.581
(Mr. Ha Hyun Jin, your loan application
has been successfully submitted.)

($50,000, 20.9 percent interest rate)

00:43:35.983 --> 00:43:38.085
This has been Team Leader Park Min Su...

00:43:38.685 --> 00:43:40.454
from Daehwan Loan Services.

00:44:08.148 --> 00:44:09.349
(Mr. Ha Hyun Jin, your loan application
has been approved.)

(My wife)

No.

00:45:11.178 --> 00:45:12.045
No.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.681
Dad!

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.854
Dad!

00:45:20.854 --> 00:45:22.055
What are you doing?

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.525
So Min, I'm sorry.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.695
I was so stupid.

00:45:29.363 --> 00:45:32.499
No, Dad. Hold on.

00:45:32.499 --> 00:45:34.668
Dad.

00:45:39.339 --> 00:45:40.841
I love you, sweetheart.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:44.745
Forgive me.

00:45:46.713 --> 00:45:47.714
I'm sorry.

00:45:58.292 --> 00:45:59.359
Dad.

00:46:15.776 --> 00:46:17.244
Someone fell.

00:46:17.244 --> 00:46:19.046
Call 911 now.

00:46:19.046 --> 00:46:20.447
- Call 911.
- Hello?

00:46:21.248 --> 00:46:22.950
Someone just fell.

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.184
Please come fast.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.756
(No Mercy)

00:47:02.756 --> 00:47:04.925
We're from the Seongan Police Agency,
voice phishing crime unit.

00:47:04.925 --> 00:47:05.826
No, wait a minute.

00:47:05.826 --> 00:47:08.128
They say you have connections
with a crime syndicate.

00:47:08.128 --> 00:47:10.097
Every time I see her,
she's got the same outfit on.

00:47:10.097 --> 00:47:11.298
Who are you?

00:47:11.298 --> 00:47:12.900
Why are you pretending to be my mom?

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.035
Based on your dad's phone records,

00:47:15.035 --> 00:47:16.370
we've confirmed
that your mom's missing is...

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:18.071
linked with the Ilseong clan.

00:47:18.071 --> 00:47:20.240
What can I help you?

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.408
How...

00:47:21.408 --> 00:47:22.276
Who are you?

00:47:22.276 --> 00:47:23.577
I told you already...

00:47:23.577 --> 00:47:24.912
that your mom's always by your side.

00:47:24.912 --> 00:47:26.647
I borrowed your mom.

00:47:26.647 --> 00:47:28.515
I'm going to kill you.

00:47:28.515 --> 00:47:29.750
Where are they going?

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:31.151
It's orders from higher-ups.

00:47:31.151 --> 00:47:33.086
Looks like they want to cover this up
as quietly as possible.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.023
Who do I have to go through
to reach the ringleader?

00:47:37.324 --> 00:47:38.458
Where's my mom?

00:47:38.458 --> 00:47:39.760
Tell me where my mom is!
