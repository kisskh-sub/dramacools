Section 3.

00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:15.419
You did not come
here alone, did you?

00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:19.033
There's that other
participant, Tristan Bangkat.

00:02:19.058 --> 00:02:20.368
I don't know him.

00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:21.911
My mom lives here.

00:02:21.911 --> 00:02:23.179
I came to visit her.

00:02:23.204 --> 00:02:24.685
But I'm still your mom.

00:02:24.747 --> 00:02:27.125
I can't help but be bothered by
what's been happening to you.

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:28.876
I'm always on your side, Lin.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.628
I heard shit went down, bro.

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:31.521
Tell me more.

00:02:31.546 --> 00:02:33.089
I was caught but
I didn't go to jail.

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.732
We have nothing
more to talk about.

00:02:36.592 --> 00:02:42.098
As you know, the National
College Entrance Test is upon us.

00:02:42.098 --> 00:02:49.272
Every Filipino student on their
senior year is expected to take the NCET.

00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:51.566
Oh, Tristan.

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:54.527
You need to prepare
for this exam, okay?

00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:57.780
Mrs. Bangkat, didn't
Tristan tell you?

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.115
Will I be suspended, ma'am?

00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:00.133
Suspended?

00:03:00.158 --> 00:03:01.008
No!

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:02.785
Ma'am, just a moment.

00:03:03.202 --> 00:03:05.079
I'm begging you.

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:09.333
The universities declared
that all STIC results,

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:12.712
from that round are
automatically invalid.

00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:20.972
Bank, what's this?

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:23.973
What's going on?

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:28.770
Are we here to talk about
what happened at STIC?

00:03:29.604 --> 00:03:30.688
I saw the news too.

00:03:32.607 --> 00:03:34.317
We don't have any information about that.

00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:38.321
Anyway, we're good, Lin.

00:03:38.738 --> 00:03:39.864
No one's coming after us anymore.

00:03:40.364 --> 00:03:42.033
No reruns, no retakes.

00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:44.118
That's the clients' problem now.

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:48.873
And our dads found out
about the STIC tests, but

00:03:49.207 --> 00:03:50.625
they're not calling the cops.

00:03:53.252 --> 00:03:54.266
That's how it is.

00:03:55.838 --> 00:03:58.508
Because if they're decent
parents, they'll protect you.

00:04:00.343 --> 00:04:01.343
But Lin,

00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:04.472
we're not here to talk about STIC.

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.140
We need your help.

00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:08.976
We have a new plan.

00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:12.437
What's the plan?

00:04:13.898 --> 00:04:16.317
The National College Entrance Test.

00:04:16.943 --> 00:04:17.945
NCET?

00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:20.258
NCET.

00:04:21.322 --> 00:04:22.840
There will be more clients,

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:25.535
Because the whole Philippines
will be taking that test.

00:04:28.204 --> 00:04:29.121
I don't believe this.

00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:31.958
We're just through with
what happened in the STIC.

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:33.709
Bank, you already got caught.

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:35.169
The news already leaked.

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.631
So we're really going to repeat all that?

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:40.775
For what?

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.094
For ten million pesos.

00:04:45.054 --> 00:04:47.014
Ten million pesos each.

00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:47.723
Damn!

00:04:47.723 --> 00:04:48.724
Ten million?

00:04:50.434 --> 00:04:51.602
Wow, Lin!

00:04:51.602 --> 00:04:54.730
STIC and NCET are different.

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:56.983
There's only one
timezone in the Philippines

00:04:56.983 --> 00:04:59.527
and a single schedule for all the students.

00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:01.904
Your plan is impossible, Bank.

00:05:03.155 --> 00:05:05.157
We won't be taking it
with the other test takers.

00:05:06.325 --> 00:05:07.869
We'll get the test exam first.

00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:10.204
Before the exam date.

00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:13.082
Lin, Banky's plan is solid.

00:05:13.082 --> 00:05:14.041
I think this will work.

00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:16.169
- This is easy.
- No.

00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:18.713
I already said this before.

00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:20.171
I'm done.

00:05:21.716 --> 00:05:25.595
If you need money, why don't
you use my share from STIC?

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.221
You can split that.

00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:30.099
Sis, that's not enough.

00:05:31.893 --> 00:05:33.144
You know, Pat and I,

00:05:33.853 --> 00:05:36.480
we could use that
money to start over again.

00:05:36.981 --> 00:05:39.108
And just be free.

00:05:40.318 --> 00:05:41.318
Finally.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.655
And twenty million?

00:05:44.947 --> 00:05:46.657
I mean for the both of us.

00:05:47.602 --> 00:05:48.628
That...

00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:50.578
That would change our lives!

00:05:51.787 --> 00:05:52.816
Come on, Lin.

00:05:54.206 --> 00:05:56.363
Haven't we learned from the STIC?

00:05:57.084 --> 00:05:58.169
Even at school?

00:05:59.337 --> 00:06:00.007
Grace,

00:06:00.032 --> 00:06:01.826
what we're doing is a crime.

00:06:06.685 --> 00:06:07.685
Please,

00:06:08.154 --> 00:06:09.739
don't include me in your plans anymore.

00:06:09.764 --> 00:06:11.307
I'm done with cheating.

00:06:13.403 --> 00:06:14.403
Lin.

00:06:15.193 --> 00:06:16.698
Wait, there's something you need to know.

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.483
In compliance with our school regulations,

00:06:22.443 --> 00:06:24.403
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Ma'am, but

00:06:25.193 --> 00:06:26.444
Tristan Bangkat,

00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:29.307
you are expelled effective today.

00:06:31.744 --> 00:06:32.787
I'm expelled.

00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:35.998
It's already on my permanent
records the expulsion and cheating.

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:38.751
I can't go to med school anymore.

00:06:39.418 --> 00:06:41.963
I have no hope left, I won't
become a doctor anymore.

00:06:42.922 --> 00:06:44.507
Why didn't you tell me this right away?

00:06:44.757 --> 00:06:45.967
We met, didn't we?

00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:47.718
I could've done something, Bank.

00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:49.595
There's nothing more we can do, Lin.

00:06:50.763 --> 00:06:51.806
It hurts, yes.

00:06:52.765 --> 00:06:55.101
But I accept it now,
that this is as far as I go.

00:06:56.352 --> 00:06:57.870
That's why I need the NCET.

00:06:58.396 --> 00:06:59.563
If I'm not going to
become a doctor anymore,

00:06:59.563 --> 00:07:02.549
I need the money for
my future and for Mom.

00:07:02.942 --> 00:07:04.443
That's my only way, Lin.

00:07:07.947 --> 00:07:08.990
But it's up to you.

00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:12.185
While you can still study in Australia.

00:07:12.623 --> 00:07:13.709
You still have a choice.

00:07:14.662 --> 00:07:15.662
But me,

00:07:16.706 --> 00:07:18.146
I have no choice left, Lin.

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:26.298
If I help all of you with the NCET,

00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:29.218
are you sure this is the last?

00:07:29.802 --> 00:07:30.678
Promise, Lin.

00:07:30.678 --> 00:07:31.787
This is the last one.

00:07:33.305 --> 00:07:34.349
Yes, sis.

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:36.033
This is the last one.

00:07:36.058 --> 00:07:37.373
After this,

00:07:38.394 --> 00:07:39.395
no more cheating.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.273
We just have to do this,

00:07:44.158 --> 00:07:45.158
together.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.120
Okay.

00:07:58.184 --> 00:07:59.209
Let's do this.

00:08:00.124 --> 00:08:01.751
One last time.

00:09:00.309 --> 00:09:01.202
Hello, Mom?

00:09:01.227 --> 00:09:02.180
Lin!

00:09:02.205 --> 00:09:03.498
Hi, Lin!

00:09:04.563 --> 00:09:06.607
I'm so happy we
were able to talk again.

00:09:06.607 --> 00:09:07.483
But sorry, okay?

00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:10.662
I was only able to call now because
so many things are happening.

00:09:10.687 --> 00:09:12.596
But I got your message.

00:09:12.822 --> 00:09:14.573
And thank you, thank you.

00:09:14.573 --> 00:09:16.242
And I'm happy because

00:09:16.242 --> 00:09:18.786
you've decided that you'll study here.

00:09:18.786 --> 00:09:19.779
Yay!

00:09:19.804 --> 00:09:22.679
And Lin, I still have
to get the place ready.

00:09:22.998 --> 00:09:26.460
I also need to know what
documents you need to submit.

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:30.965
So, well, I just want you to know
that it's not just us who are happy,

00:09:30.965 --> 00:09:33.843
everyone's excited, especially Carson.

00:09:35.094 --> 00:09:36.804
Oh Lin, what? What's wrong?

00:09:37.346 --> 00:09:39.014
Oh, have you talked to your dad already?

00:09:39.014 --> 00:09:40.266
What did he say?

00:09:40.516 --> 00:09:41.617
That's it, Mom.

00:09:42.184 --> 00:09:44.895
I haven't had the
chance to talk to dad.

00:09:45.855 --> 00:09:47.606
I'm just waiting for the perfect time.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.608
Oh, that's okay.

00:09:49.775 --> 00:09:51.627
We're not in a rush, right?

00:09:51.652 --> 00:09:55.114
What's important is that
you talk to your dad first,

00:09:55.447 --> 00:09:57.049
then we'll plan, right?

00:09:57.074 --> 00:09:58.242
All right mom.

00:09:59.285 --> 00:10:01.662
I'm also thinking about...

00:10:02.955 --> 00:10:04.014
Vin!

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:05.499
Hey Vin, is that you?

00:10:05.666 --> 00:10:07.437
No, no. It's okay.
Just talk.

00:10:07.543 --> 00:10:08.310
It's fine.

00:10:08.335 --> 00:10:09.773
Oh no Vin, don't.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.005
Sit beside Lin.

00:10:11.005 --> 00:10:12.289
Let's talk now.

00:10:12.314 --> 00:10:14.024
Let's talk like a family.

00:10:14.049 --> 00:10:15.102
Come here, Dad.

00:10:18.304 --> 00:10:19.359
Thank you, Nona.

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:22.141
Did I understand correctly? It's like...

00:10:23.348 --> 00:10:24.974
our Lin has already decided.

00:10:25.477 --> 00:10:26.145
That's right.

00:10:26.145 --> 00:10:30.117
We need to talk first
because of course we need

00:10:30.142 --> 00:10:32.395
to know what you're going to say.

00:10:32.443 --> 00:10:35.654
Because I don't want this to
cause any misunderstanding.

00:10:35.654 --> 00:10:36.664
You know that.

00:10:37.072 --> 00:10:40.784
No need, we're mature people—
what matters is Lin's future.

00:10:42.578 --> 00:10:43.871
Right, right.

00:10:45.206 --> 00:10:46.211
Thank you, Dad.

00:10:48.268 --> 00:10:49.268
Mom.

00:10:49.793 --> 00:10:52.671
My mind hasn't changed but

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:54.798
I would like to move the date.

00:10:55.424 --> 00:10:56.842
I'll leave next month.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.471
I'll just stay here with
Dad for his birthday.

00:11:01.263 --> 00:11:02.556
No problem, Lin.

00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:04.183
Don't worry about that.

00:11:04.642 --> 00:11:08.270
Um, Vin, thank you.

00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:10.189
Thank you because...

00:11:10.606 --> 00:11:13.609
you gave me this chance
to be a mother to Lin again.

00:11:14.068 --> 00:11:15.068
Thank you so much.

00:11:22.076 --> 00:11:23.494
Okay, bye mom.

00:11:23.869 --> 00:11:24.890
I love you.

00:11:27.322 --> 00:11:28.322
See you soon.

00:11:32.711 --> 00:11:33.711
Thank you, Dad.

00:11:35.047 --> 00:11:36.047
Love you.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.340
Love you.

00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:44.949
Thanks.

00:11:44.974 --> 00:11:45.532
Thank you.

00:11:45.557 --> 00:11:46.642
Oh, you're just in time.

00:11:46.642 --> 00:11:47.993
Here's some freshly cooked

00:11:48.018 --> 00:11:49.144
Banana fritters.

00:11:49.144 --> 00:11:50.179
Please eat.

00:11:50.562 --> 00:11:51.647
I hope you guys enjoy.

00:11:51.647 --> 00:11:52.827
Do you even eat Banana fritters?

00:11:53.432 --> 00:11:54.250
Oh, yeah.

00:11:54.275 --> 00:11:54.692
No, no, no.

00:11:54.692 --> 00:11:55.526
Thank you, Tito Choi.

00:11:55.526 --> 00:11:56.694
Actually, this is my favorite.

00:11:56.944 --> 00:11:57.991
Hey, Choi!

00:11:58.404 --> 00:12:01.782
I didn't know you have a
nice and English-speaking niece.

00:12:02.241 --> 00:12:03.284
Gosh, that's basic.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.119
Look at our faces.

00:12:05.286 --> 00:12:06.890
It runs in the blood, right?

00:12:09.081 --> 00:12:10.474
Yeah, whatever you say.

00:12:10.499 --> 00:12:11.500
She's something else.

00:12:12.501 --> 00:12:13.477
Go ahead, Lin.

00:12:13.502 --> 00:12:14.003
Just eat.

00:12:14.003 --> 00:12:15.003
Don't be shy, okay?

00:12:15.546 --> 00:12:16.005
Please.

00:12:16.005 --> 00:12:17.106
Thank you.

00:12:17.131 --> 00:12:19.717
You know, This is where
I also order

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.636
food packs for my employees.

00:12:23.304 --> 00:12:25.983
Beside being good cooks,
they're also affordable.

00:12:27.182 --> 00:12:28.233
Thank you.

00:12:28.809 --> 00:12:31.895
Thank you very much too, for
touring us around your printing press.

00:12:32.271 --> 00:12:34.546
Good thing you're not busy today.

00:12:35.607 --> 00:12:36.609
No problem with that.

00:12:36.634 --> 00:12:38.970
At least, I can help
with your research, right?

00:12:39.157 --> 00:12:41.773
Anything for my niece, Grace.

00:12:42.197 --> 00:12:42.913
Right?

00:12:42.948 --> 00:12:46.410
The timing is actually perfect
because in a few weeks,

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.765
we're going to be extremely busy here.

00:12:49.371 --> 00:12:50.648
Because of the NCET.

00:12:51.727 --> 00:12:52.741
Really?

00:12:54.918 --> 00:12:56.241
We've long been

00:12:56.266 --> 00:12:58.741
a government-accredited printing partner.

00:12:59.523 --> 00:13:00.812
So we take on

00:13:01.133 --> 00:13:05.220
the big print jobs when
the NPO can't handle them.

00:13:05.637 --> 00:13:06.637
Huh?

00:13:07.056 --> 00:13:07.849
- Really?
- Actually,

00:13:07.874 --> 00:13:12.369
we're behind schedule because
they only gave us two weeks lead time.

00:13:12.394 --> 00:13:13.585
What will happen then?

00:13:13.687 --> 00:13:15.147
NCET is on Monday.

00:13:15.981 --> 00:13:16.523
Oh, no.

00:13:16.523 --> 00:13:17.583
No problem with that.

00:13:17.608 --> 00:13:20.413
If we finish in the early
hours right before the exams,

00:13:20.778 --> 00:13:22.654
it can still reach the testing sites.

00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:23.922
So, we're good.

00:13:23.947 --> 00:13:25.093
Don't worry about it.

00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:27.618
Good day, boss.

00:13:27.951 --> 00:13:30.079
May I speak with you
even if just for a moment?

00:13:30.808 --> 00:13:32.069
My goodness, Fidel.

00:13:32.331 --> 00:13:34.291
Can't you see I have visitors?

00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:35.554
Can it be later?

00:13:35.751 --> 00:13:37.628
Now is really the right time.

00:13:37.628 --> 00:13:40.077
Because whenever I go up
to your office, you're not there.

00:13:40.297 --> 00:13:43.050
And then, when you are in
the office, I need to go home.

00:13:44.802 --> 00:13:45.652
Let's talk over there.

00:13:45.677 --> 00:13:46.726
Excuse me, girls.

00:13:53.769 --> 00:13:54.882
What now, Fidel?

00:13:55.729 --> 00:13:56.729
Huh?

00:13:58.263 --> 00:13:59.263
Another advance?

00:14:01.374 --> 00:14:01.960
Sorry, boss.

00:14:01.985 --> 00:14:04.343
You still haven't paid for last time.

00:14:04.613 --> 00:14:06.490
Oh no, Fidel, don't do anything stupid.

00:14:07.658 --> 00:14:09.885
Huh? You still have so
many mistakes in your work.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.036
Sorry, boss.

00:14:11.453 --> 00:14:13.288
I really need the money right now.

00:14:13.622 --> 00:14:15.207
But that script was from before.

00:14:15.207 --> 00:14:16.183
Isn't there anything else?

00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:18.710
We all need money here.

00:14:20.421 --> 00:14:22.273
Tito Choi is furious.

00:14:23.966 --> 00:14:25.801
I've never seen him like that before.

00:14:26.343 --> 00:14:27.277
Yeah.

00:14:27.302 --> 00:14:28.971
He's scary when he's angry.

00:14:32.224 --> 00:14:33.280
What's wrong with you?

00:14:37.729 --> 00:14:38.981
Hon, this is the admin, right?

00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:40.483
Yeah. Mhmm.

00:14:42.109 --> 00:14:42.894
Why?

00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:44.170
What are you drawing?

00:14:48.657 --> 00:14:50.117
Hon, stop!

00:14:50.117 --> 00:14:51.822
Don't! It's cute, right?

00:14:51.847 --> 00:14:53.807
Excuse me, can you do that later?

00:14:55.122 --> 00:14:56.122
Please?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.433
Lin,

00:14:57.458 --> 00:14:58.250
can you just chill?

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.376
Can't we have fun?

00:14:59.797 --> 00:15:00.939
Do you think, Pat,

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.872
that I still have time to enjoy
what we're doing right now?

00:15:04.506 --> 00:15:05.815
Just a reminder, okay?

00:15:06.008 --> 00:15:08.944
This isn't like before where
I'll just give the answers.

00:15:08.969 --> 00:15:10.637
What we're doing is a crime.

00:15:11.305 --> 00:15:13.432
We're going to steal documents.

00:15:15.142 --> 00:15:18.604
One small mistake and
for sure, we'll end up in jail.

00:15:24.794 --> 00:15:25.794
Okay.

00:15:26.487 --> 00:15:28.005
According to Tito Choi,

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.133
the clients' information
is important to them.

00:15:31.158 --> 00:15:35.120
They signed an NDA to make sure
that everything is strictly confidential.

00:15:35.454 --> 00:15:38.457
Also, documents for
printing aren't sent by email.

00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:42.686
To avoid online spread and at
the same time, prevent hacking.

00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:45.005
So, scrap the fact that we
can get the soft copy.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.215
Printing is ongoing

00:15:46.215 --> 00:15:48.832
which means we only have
a few days to prepare a plan.

00:15:49.071 --> 00:15:52.654
The earliest we can get the
documents is the day before the exam.

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:54.640
Also, CCTV cameras are everywhere.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.684
Even if we get them, they'll
have strong evidence against us.

00:15:59.394 --> 00:16:00.771
The chance is low.

00:16:01.522 --> 00:16:02.814
But it's not zero, right?

00:16:03.148 --> 00:16:05.082
We just really need to plan carefully.

00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:09.191
But we also prepared for the STIC.

00:16:10.405 --> 00:16:11.847
But you still got caught.

00:16:13.951 --> 00:16:15.168
I was the only one caught.

00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:17.829
But it didn't ruin the plan, right?

00:16:17.913 --> 00:16:19.581
The clients still received
what they needed,

00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:21.350
the answers, and they passed.

00:16:21.375 --> 00:16:22.855
So if we managed before,

00:16:23.794 --> 00:16:25.087
we can do more now.

00:16:27.023 --> 00:16:28.023
Fine.

00:16:28.715 --> 00:16:31.134
I'll walk you through the
main process of printing

00:16:31.134 --> 00:16:32.594
so we're all in-sync.

00:16:32.594 --> 00:16:33.668
Okay?

00:16:33.762 --> 00:16:35.430
These are the five main processes.

00:16:35.681 --> 00:16:37.355
One, sampling.

00:16:37.641 --> 00:16:38.642
Actual printing.

00:16:39.184 --> 00:16:40.369
Quality assurance.

00:16:40.394 --> 00:16:41.370
Packaging.

00:16:41.395 --> 00:16:42.613
And dispatch.

00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:45.349
Keep this in mind, guys,
because this is where we'll look for

00:16:45.374 --> 00:16:47.877
the possible window to
get a copy of the exam,

00:16:47.902 --> 00:16:48.877
okay?

00:16:48.902 --> 00:16:50.237
Okay, run it, teacher Lin.

00:16:50.904 --> 00:16:52.005
Okay.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.532
At the sampling stage,

00:16:53.532 --> 00:16:57.703
this is where they print samples to
check if the color and formatting are okay.

00:16:57.728 --> 00:17:00.063
But if there's a problem at
this stage, they then adjust the

00:17:00.088 --> 00:17:02.543
color plate to the
correct color and format.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.918
Once they adjust the color plate,

00:17:04.918 --> 00:17:07.838
they then proceed to the next
step which is actual printing.

00:17:08.171 --> 00:17:10.632
Now, once the documents
are printed, they then imprint

00:17:10.632 --> 00:17:12.759
a barcode for each and every single copy

00:17:12.759 --> 00:17:15.345
so they can trace it if
a copy goes missing.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:17.197
After that,

00:17:17.222 --> 00:17:20.642
they bring all the printed copies
to the QA and packaging room.

00:17:21.184 --> 00:17:23.312
All the good copies,
go straight to packaging.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.856
But all the damaged
copies, even if readable,

00:17:25.856 --> 00:17:29.568
if there's misalignment or even a small
error, they're disposed of immediately.

00:17:30.277 --> 00:17:32.362
Now, if the documents are confidential,

00:17:32.821 --> 00:17:35.616
they run them through
shredding before disposal.

00:17:36.283 --> 00:17:37.284
Around here.

00:17:37.868 --> 00:17:39.543
Now guys, please take note

00:17:39.911 --> 00:17:44.124
that they record the barcode numbers
of the copies they shred for tracing.

00:17:46.543 --> 00:17:49.129
And finally, in the QA and packaging room,

00:17:49.129 --> 00:17:51.882
there's a connecting
door to the dispatch room.

00:17:52.299 --> 00:17:54.926
So once all of the documents
are packed and sealed,

00:17:54.926 --> 00:17:58.004
they then proceed to the final
stage which is dispatch for delivery.

00:18:04.502 --> 00:18:05.502
Got it?

00:18:05.845 --> 00:18:08.931
Did you know we can get
a full copy at sampling, right?

00:18:11.151 --> 00:18:12.486
I've thought of that.

00:18:13.904 --> 00:18:17.032
But Tito Choi said, printing is ongoing.

00:18:17.366 --> 00:18:19.451
So all the samples have been thrown away.

00:18:21.036 --> 00:18:24.081
The window where we
can get a copy of the exam

00:18:24.081 --> 00:18:25.916
is before it's packed and delivered.

00:18:25.916 --> 00:18:27.084
Around here.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.464
But security's really tight.

00:18:32.798 --> 00:18:34.466
They're super strict, right?

00:18:35.884 --> 00:18:38.949
They're so strict that even
if there's just a slight error

00:18:39.554 --> 00:18:42.057
and it's still readable, it's discarded.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.603
Maybe we can get a damaged
copy before it's shredded.

00:18:47.312 --> 00:18:50.273
That would also be the safest
copy because it can't be traced.

00:18:51.692 --> 00:18:54.986
But we just need someone
inside who will work for us.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.990
Right.

00:19:00.283 --> 00:19:01.285
I like that.

00:19:01.618 --> 00:19:03.870
We should look for someone we can pay.

00:19:11.294 --> 00:19:12.324
Ma'am, Sir...

00:19:12.838 --> 00:19:14.339
you've ordered so much.

00:19:16.091 --> 00:19:17.332
Please take some.

00:19:17.384 --> 00:19:18.385
Please eat.

00:19:20.345 --> 00:19:21.355
Go ahead, kuys.

00:19:21.805 --> 00:19:23.432
We're still full.
That's all for you.

00:19:24.141 --> 00:19:25.225
All of this mine?

00:19:26.435 --> 00:19:28.228
Ma'am Grace, maybe

00:19:28.228 --> 00:19:30.814
you'll hang me after
feeding me this much?

00:19:32.274 --> 00:19:33.483
No, Kuya Fidel.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.904
It's a work opportunity.

00:19:39.114 --> 00:19:40.114
Work?

00:19:41.021 --> 00:19:42.773
I have work but okay.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.703
What, what job is that?

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.922
Can you help us get a copy
of the NCET exam paper?

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.050
Wait sir, okay?

00:20:02.012 --> 00:20:02.946
It seems...

00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:04.918
It seems difficult, that
thing you're asking because

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.371
first, it's dangerous.

00:20:06.641 --> 00:20:08.269
Second, if Boss catches me,

00:20:08.393 --> 00:20:09.686
I'll be in trouble.

00:20:09.686 --> 00:20:10.886
You know, Ma'am,

00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:12.230
he's still pissed at me.

00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:13.190
Maybe—

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.525
Even if we pay you 100,000?

00:20:21.364 --> 00:20:22.364
One?

00:20:23.617 --> 00:20:24.746
One hundred thousand?

00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:29.414
The offer can still increase depending
on your involvement in our plan.

00:20:30.457 --> 00:20:31.464
So, are you G?

00:20:34.127 --> 00:20:36.386
Not that it matters, but,

00:20:36.713 --> 00:20:38.757
where will you get that much money?

00:20:46.014 --> 00:20:49.351
As per request, you
already have 800 clients.

00:20:49.351 --> 00:20:50.394
Thanks to me.

00:20:50.936 --> 00:20:54.731
Just make sure they get 280 over 300.

00:20:54.731 --> 00:20:56.233
Because that's what I promised them.

00:20:57.776 --> 00:20:59.069
Thank you, Ms. Maya.

00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:03.532
Did you also bring their IDs?

00:21:07.235 --> 00:21:08.235
Wait.

00:21:08.787 --> 00:21:10.872
What are the IDs for?

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.785
What will you do with them?

00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:16.086
Because they asked me,
and I don't know what to answer.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.339
Aren't they entitled to
know that as clients?

00:21:20.841 --> 00:21:24.636
With all due respect, Ms. Maya,
but we can't disclose that information

00:21:24.636 --> 00:21:26.930
for the safety of everyone involved.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.642
But I can ensure you that we can
inform the clients once their IDs are done.

00:21:32.394 --> 00:21:33.728
So secretive.

00:21:34.813 --> 00:21:36.356
Well, okay, for my client's safety.

00:21:36.356 --> 00:21:37.899
I won't give this to you either.

00:21:38.108 --> 00:21:39.317
Wait a moment,

00:21:39.818 --> 00:21:41.444
we need their IDs.

00:21:41.444 --> 00:21:43.947
Because that's where we'll
put the answers for the exam.

00:21:45.198 --> 00:21:46.198
How?

00:21:47.492 --> 00:21:48.952
When we found out

00:21:48.952 --> 00:21:51.788
the IDs are the only thing that
you can bring into the exam room,

00:21:52.664 --> 00:21:55.375
given that NCET and pencils
are provided on the day.

00:21:56.418 --> 00:21:57.425
Yes.

00:21:57.961 --> 00:22:01.715
This is their precautionary measure
after what happened at STIC.

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:03.800
Nice!

00:22:04.301 --> 00:22:05.468
Game changer.

00:22:05.635 --> 00:22:06.803
Anyways,

00:22:06.803 --> 00:22:09.222
since only IDs can be
brought into the exam room,

00:22:09.222 --> 00:22:11.600
the answers— we printed
on the barcode sticker.

00:22:11.808 --> 00:22:14.227
and the number will represent
the answer on the exam.

00:22:18.815 --> 00:22:20.317
Can we get them?

00:22:23.278 --> 00:22:25.655
Actually, I just realized.

00:22:26.156 --> 00:22:28.825
My involvement is actually vital here.

00:22:29.618 --> 00:22:30.952
I'm thinking of

00:22:30.952 --> 00:22:31.953
raising my cut?

00:22:33.038 --> 00:22:36.291
Instead of just 5 percent,
make it 10 percent.

00:22:36.426 --> 00:22:37.430
Is that okay?

00:22:37.455 --> 00:22:38.466
Wait.

00:22:40.337 --> 00:22:42.047
It seems like there are too many demands.

00:22:43.506 --> 00:22:44.841
Isn't that unfair to us?

00:22:45.884 --> 00:22:46.896
Unfair?

00:22:47.469 --> 00:22:50.221
You have clients because of me
Is it still unfair?

00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:52.459
So,

00:22:52.641 --> 00:22:53.756
do we have a deal?

00:22:56.645 --> 00:22:57.779
Okay.

00:23:00.148 --> 00:23:01.900
We'll give you your 10 percent.

00:23:03.026 --> 00:23:04.646
But you'll hire the people...

00:23:05.028 --> 00:23:07.530
who will get their IDs at the testing sites

00:23:08.239 --> 00:23:09.658
so they won't take them from us,

00:23:09.991 --> 00:23:11.717
they won't take them from you either.

00:23:12.285 --> 00:23:13.287
Fine.

00:23:14.055 --> 00:23:15.431
I'll take care of that.

00:23:15.997 --> 00:23:18.333
I'll just message you the bank details.

00:23:23.296 --> 00:23:24.923
Thank you, Ms. Maya.

00:23:33.515 --> 00:23:34.693
He's an hour late.

00:23:35.151 --> 00:23:36.652
Are you sure he's made up his mind?

00:23:38.061 --> 00:23:39.079
Yeah.

00:23:39.104 --> 00:23:40.355
He said he was G.

00:23:40.897 --> 00:23:42.148
Can you just chill?

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.233
So impatient.

00:23:43.233 --> 00:23:44.651
Maybe he's stuck in traffic.

00:23:47.862 --> 00:23:49.489
Pat, how sure are you

00:23:49.489 --> 00:23:51.758
that he'll agree to help us with our plan?

00:23:51.783 --> 00:23:53.034
Well, money talks.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.286
I offered him 300k.

00:23:55.537 --> 00:23:57.607
But he's actually gonna
help us to the heist.

00:23:58.707 --> 00:24:01.292
He has a child too,
so I think he'll go for it.

00:24:01.292 --> 00:24:03.537
Yeah, if you saw his reaction, guys,

00:24:03.712 --> 00:24:06.089
from that reaction, he's for
sure gonna take the money.

00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:07.674
He badly needs it.

00:24:10.344 --> 00:24:11.348
Well,

00:24:12.144 --> 00:24:14.420
desperate measure calls
for desperate actions.

00:24:15.181 --> 00:24:16.933
He needs the money for his family.

00:24:17.267 --> 00:24:18.279
Like you.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.689
Maybe they're just trying to survive.

00:24:24.357 --> 00:24:25.984
You know, I get your point.

00:24:27.027 --> 00:24:30.280
But I don't think survival is an
excuse to do something wrong.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.465
Because whatever your reason,

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:33.482
if you're wrong,

00:24:33.742 --> 00:24:34.756
you're wrong.

00:24:35.834 --> 00:24:36.834
Right?

00:24:41.541 --> 00:24:42.541
Sir.

00:24:43.126 --> 00:24:44.144
It's about time.

00:24:44.169 --> 00:24:44.794
Hi, kuya.

00:24:44.794 --> 00:24:46.963
Speaking of the devil. Sup, Kuya Fidel?

00:24:48.673 --> 00:24:50.029
Here's Bank, by the way.

00:24:50.175 --> 00:24:51.303
- Lin.
- Sir.

00:24:53.094 --> 00:24:54.146
Ma'am.

00:24:54.471 --> 00:24:55.471
Lin.

00:24:55.597 --> 00:24:57.432
Sorry I'm late.

00:24:58.767 --> 00:24:59.873
But,

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.828
let me clarify again,

00:25:01.853 --> 00:25:04.773
the reason I accepted this

00:25:04.798 --> 00:25:07.884
is because I really need
money for my child's insulin.

00:25:09.027 --> 00:25:12.389
Because Boss Choi, even though
I've worked for him for a long time,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.888
he's stingy.

00:25:14.066 --> 00:25:16.185
They never increased my salary there.

00:25:16.576 --> 00:25:18.369
So the money I have left,

00:25:18.369 --> 00:25:20.205
that little amount,

00:25:20.205 --> 00:25:21.810
I used it to gamble. But,

00:25:21.961 --> 00:25:23.337
bad luck, I always lose.

00:25:24.084 --> 00:25:25.185
But okay.

00:25:25.293 --> 00:25:27.253
For my child, I'll gamble here.

00:25:28.546 --> 00:25:29.717
That's my guy.

00:25:30.757 --> 00:25:32.258
Well, don't worry, Kuya Fidel.

00:25:32.675 --> 00:25:34.068
We're not gonna judge you.

00:25:34.344 --> 00:25:34.986
Thanks.

00:25:35.011 --> 00:25:35.695
Okay.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.696
Alright.

00:25:36.721 --> 00:25:38.306
So, here's the plan I thought of.

00:25:38.973 --> 00:25:40.683
While printing is happening,

00:25:41.392 --> 00:25:44.162
Kuya Fidel will casually
go to the QA room.

00:25:44.187 --> 00:25:46.523
He'll get the test
paper's damaged copy,

00:25:48.316 --> 00:25:49.818
then you'll send it to us.

00:25:49.818 --> 00:25:53.863
I can't be the one to take
the test paper out because

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.033
we get body-checked
when leaving the factory.

00:25:57.033 --> 00:25:58.618
I'll get caught for that.

00:26:01.371 --> 00:26:02.914
What if you just use your phone instead,

00:26:02.914 --> 00:26:05.333
take photos of the test
papers, then send them to us.

00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:08.336
Cellphones, sir, and all kinds of cameras

00:26:09.379 --> 00:26:11.303
are surrendered to the guard. So,

00:26:11.785 --> 00:26:13.036
that's a no-go, Sir.

00:26:13.061 --> 00:26:14.092
Yeah, Bank.

00:26:14.676 --> 00:26:16.444
I already mentioned this before.

00:26:16.469 --> 00:26:18.179
They're checked at the entrance.

00:26:18.805 --> 00:26:22.475
So we need to get a phone inside
without going through the entrance.

00:26:25.061 --> 00:26:27.105
What if through food delivery?

00:26:28.231 --> 00:26:29.207
Lin,

00:26:29.232 --> 00:26:32.527
remember the woman selling
maruya at the food stall we ate at?

00:26:32.902 --> 00:26:34.112
Ah, yes.

00:26:34.487 --> 00:26:35.947
Tito Choi said,

00:26:36.281 --> 00:26:38.533
they usually order food packs there.

00:26:40.118 --> 00:26:41.077
Perfect timing.

00:26:41.077 --> 00:26:43.163
We'll put the phone inside the food packs

00:26:43.538 --> 00:26:45.623
and then mark them so
you can spot them easily.

00:26:45.623 --> 00:26:46.697
Is that okay?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.086
Sir, that's risky because this area,

00:26:50.879 --> 00:26:53.006
as far as I recall, has...

00:26:53.381 --> 00:26:56.467
one to four CCTVs.

00:26:56.676 --> 00:26:58.428
It's really risky, Sir.

00:27:02.348 --> 00:27:05.602
We need a power outage
so the CCTVs won't work.

00:27:05.602 --> 00:27:08.813
Unless the printing press has a generator.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.149
They don't have a generator there.

00:27:11.357 --> 00:27:12.384
There!

00:27:12.734 --> 00:27:13.744
Perfect.

00:27:14.402 --> 00:27:15.753
Power outage is the way.

00:27:15.778 --> 00:27:18.715
When there's no power,
you stop operation.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.658
No CCTV, complete darkness.

00:27:20.867 --> 00:27:23.578
No one will see you taking
pictures of the test papers.

00:27:24.537 --> 00:27:25.180
Yeah.

00:27:25.205 --> 00:27:26.973
Bro, I think that's the plan.

00:27:26.998 --> 00:27:29.083
Ah, that's not possible either, Sir.

00:27:29.083 --> 00:27:31.285
Because when there's a brownout...

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.088
everyone is sent out of the factory.

00:27:34.088 --> 00:27:37.008
Only Boss Choi is allowed in.

00:27:37.008 --> 00:27:38.193
We'd just come back later,

00:27:38.218 --> 00:27:41.471
when the power's back, so it's
unlikely I can get in while it's dark.

00:27:42.388 --> 00:27:43.765
Figure something out, bro.

00:27:43.765 --> 00:27:44.769
Oh no, Sir.

00:27:44.794 --> 00:27:47.463
It's not part of our agreement
that I would lose my job.

00:27:47.685 --> 00:27:51.022
Also, I don't even know what
you'll ask me to photograph.

00:27:51.022 --> 00:27:52.398
I might mess up later.

00:27:54.484 --> 00:27:55.558
If so,

00:27:56.402 --> 00:27:59.739
one of us must pretend to
be an electrician to get inside.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.027
And he's the one who will
send the test papers to us.

00:28:10.434 --> 00:28:11.434
Me?

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.603
Why me? Why not you?

00:28:13.628 --> 00:28:14.045
What are you?

00:28:14.045 --> 00:28:14.938
Why me?

00:28:14.963 --> 00:28:16.027
Why us?

00:28:16.297 --> 00:28:17.924
Lin and I will be taking the exam, right.

00:28:17.924 --> 00:28:19.496
So we're already waiting by the van.

00:28:19.759 --> 00:28:20.301
- Bro.
- It's unlikely

00:28:20.301 --> 00:28:22.371
for Grace to pretend to be an electrician?

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.051
Bro, I don't want that.

00:28:25.515 --> 00:28:27.141
I'm not the right person for it.

00:28:27.141 --> 00:28:29.519
Yeah, you talk to me as
a client, but not like that.

00:28:29.544 --> 00:28:32.152
I'm not even a fucking
electrician. What would I do there?

00:28:32.188 --> 00:28:34.232
Messing with wires?
I'll look like an idiot!

00:28:34.232 --> 00:28:35.984
Then you'll expect me
to bring you the

00:28:35.984 --> 00:28:37.379
damaged test papers?!

00:28:38.152 --> 00:28:39.230
Okay, fine.

00:28:39.445 --> 00:28:41.066
We'll hire a real electrician.

00:28:41.322 --> 00:28:43.783
But you still have to be the
one to send the test papers to us.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.176
Wait, Bank.

00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:46.327
Are you sure?

00:28:47.078 --> 00:28:50.707
Isn't it too dangerous if we
add more people to our plan?

00:28:51.483 --> 00:28:53.151
Guys, can we even trust them?

00:28:54.419 --> 00:28:55.228
Lin.

00:28:55.267 --> 00:28:57.561
They're just outsiders like Maya's crew.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.215
It's not personal so the risk is lower.

00:28:59.215 --> 00:29:00.024
Besides,

00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:01.637
we have no other way.

00:29:01.759 --> 00:29:04.721
We really need someone to fix the
power while Pat is in the QA room.

00:29:07.181 --> 00:29:09.600
So, do you know any
electrician who can be bribed?

00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:15.356
My nanny's brother is an electrician.

00:29:15.554 --> 00:29:16.638
We can trust him.

00:29:17.741 --> 00:29:18.710
Hon.

00:29:18.735 --> 00:29:20.668
Are you okay with me going in?

00:29:20.695 --> 00:29:24.032
Well, of course it's not okay with me
but we don't have any other choice.

00:29:25.658 --> 00:29:27.952
Hon, please, do it for us.

00:29:30.527 --> 00:29:31.527
Pat,

00:29:31.754 --> 00:29:33.124
there won't be a problem.

00:29:33.875 --> 00:29:35.643
We'll plan this carefully.

00:29:35.668 --> 00:29:37.683
This whole thing, this is the panel.

00:29:38.588 --> 00:29:40.424
These two are the circuit breakers.

00:29:40.449 --> 00:29:42.242
Then these are the power cables.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:45.831
Just remember these basics so when
they ask you, you know something.

00:29:46.846 --> 00:29:47.905
So Kuya Fidel,

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.223
once you get the phone,

00:29:49.515 --> 00:29:51.659
make a way to cause a power outage.

00:29:51.684 --> 00:29:53.036
Short circuit, can you do it?

00:29:53.061 --> 00:29:54.020
Possible, sir.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.313
But the problem is,

00:29:55.938 --> 00:29:58.488
before you reach the breaker,
you have to pass through the admin.

00:29:58.941 --> 00:30:00.027
But,

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.409
I think I can figure out a way.

00:30:02.987 --> 00:30:04.019
Okay.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.740
When the power goes out,

00:30:06.115 --> 00:30:07.950
pretend to call an electrician.

00:30:08.451 --> 00:30:09.118
Okay, sir.

00:30:09.118 --> 00:30:10.754
And that's when you go in, Pat.

00:30:11.245 --> 00:30:12.872
You go with the real electrician.

00:30:13.373 --> 00:30:16.209
Kuya Fidel will meet
you, hand you the phone.

00:30:16.459 --> 00:30:18.461
And you, Kuya Fidel,
you'll just leave right away.

00:30:18.878 --> 00:30:19.896
And Pat,

00:30:19.921 --> 00:30:22.871
the real electrician will be
left in the electrical room.

00:30:23.049 --> 00:30:24.988
He'll pretend to fix the power.

00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:27.708
And you, Pat, go to the QA room.

00:30:28.012 --> 00:30:30.166
Use all that time to

00:30:30.191 --> 00:30:32.892
photograph and send
us every single test paper.

00:30:32.975 --> 00:30:34.202
And when you're done,

00:30:34.227 --> 00:30:37.324
you can signal him to
actually fix the power again.

00:30:38.022 --> 00:30:39.082
Are you serious?

00:30:39.107 --> 00:30:40.277
That's a long route, see?

00:30:40.566 --> 00:30:41.734
Then make a way!

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:43.611
Go to the restroom or whatever.

00:30:44.278 --> 00:30:45.405
Actually, Sir, that's right.

00:30:45.405 --> 00:30:46.801
Because from here...

00:30:47.573 --> 00:30:50.785
going toward the parking area, there's...

00:30:51.661 --> 00:30:52.980
there's a restroom here.

00:30:53.121 --> 00:30:54.143
You can go through there.

00:30:54.168 --> 00:30:55.748
Also, Sir, from up there,

00:30:55.748 --> 00:30:57.166
there's a small window.

00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:58.230
It overlooks the QA.

00:30:59.144 --> 00:31:00.520
Wait, what about the phones?

00:31:00.545 --> 00:31:02.379
He'll be caught by the guard at the exit.

00:31:04.215 --> 00:31:07.193
The phone needs to be hidden
in a place that's really not obvious.

00:31:07.218 --> 00:31:08.970
Everything inside must be wiped clean.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.847
Sir, in— in the restroom,

00:31:11.055 --> 00:31:12.765
there's a drain with a cover.

00:31:12.974 --> 00:31:14.767
You can hide the cellphone there.

00:31:14.934 --> 00:31:15.576
There.

00:31:15.601 --> 00:31:16.577
Pat.

00:31:16.602 --> 00:31:19.647
before you return to the electrical
room, make sure you pass by there, okay?

00:31:19.891 --> 00:31:21.059
Don't forget.

00:31:22.151 --> 00:31:23.151
Okay.

00:31:24.627 --> 00:31:25.753
And you, Grace,

00:31:25.778 --> 00:31:27.155
you need to tell the electrician,

00:31:27.822 --> 00:31:29.490
that before he restores the power,

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.826
Pat must be in the electrical room, okay?

00:31:33.453 --> 00:31:35.580
And when everything
is done, and Pat is out,

00:31:35.913 --> 00:31:37.807
we all go together to your warehouse.

00:31:37.832 --> 00:31:40.017
There we'll print all the QR stickers.

00:31:40.042 --> 00:31:41.502
And we must send them,

00:31:41.502 --> 00:31:44.130
so we can deliver to
all the clients their IDs

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.757
before seven in the morning, understand?

00:31:48.259 --> 00:31:49.259
Pat.

00:31:50.277 --> 00:31:51.429
This depends on you.

00:31:52.638 --> 00:31:53.638
Can you do it?

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.512
Yeah, I got it.

00:32:02.773 --> 00:32:03.773
Good.

00:32:04.317 --> 00:32:05.621
If you have no more questions,

00:32:06.569 --> 00:32:07.612
that's our plan.

00:32:09.071 --> 00:32:10.406
Okay, thank you.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.240
Hey, Faye.

00:32:14.285 --> 00:32:16.662
I just got off the
electrician. He's good to go.

00:32:17.705 --> 00:32:18.556
Though,

00:32:18.581 --> 00:32:21.584
I thought he was going to back out but
it turns out he just wanted a higher rate.

00:32:23.911 --> 00:32:24.911
Okay.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.803
Are you sure you're okay, sis?

00:32:35.681 --> 00:32:36.681
Yeah.

00:32:37.225 --> 00:32:38.225
I'm okay.

00:32:39.936 --> 00:32:41.854
Maybe I'm just worried.

00:32:43.314 --> 00:32:44.774
So many people involved.

00:32:46.484 --> 00:32:48.402
Maybe we need a plan B.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Yeah.

00:32:53.616 --> 00:32:55.034
I agree with you.

00:32:55.868 --> 00:32:56.911
Is there another way?

00:32:56.911 --> 00:32:59.038
So Pat doesn't have to go back in?

00:32:59.342 --> 00:33:00.355
I know, Pat.

00:33:01.707 --> 00:33:02.785
This is kind of,

00:33:03.543 --> 00:33:05.127
weird to do.

00:33:07.338 --> 00:33:08.714
I've been there before.

00:33:10.341 --> 00:33:11.387
I even got caught.

00:33:12.468 --> 00:33:15.513
As much as I wanna have another plan,

00:33:17.265 --> 00:33:18.432
there really isn't one.

00:33:20.726 --> 00:33:21.769
This is it.

00:33:22.979 --> 00:33:24.230
We have no choice.

00:33:25.565 --> 00:33:28.442
We need to do this so we don't
go back to our miserable lives.

00:33:30.278 --> 00:33:31.278
And me?

00:33:32.738 --> 00:33:34.288
I don't want to go
back to my old life

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:36.200
buried in debt and a
broken washing machine.

00:33:39.328 --> 00:33:41.414
My life was ruined since I got expelled.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.000
I have no future, Pat.

00:33:47.295 --> 00:33:48.921
This is the only way I see to recover.

00:33:50.548 --> 00:33:51.558
As for me,

00:33:51.841 --> 00:33:54.760
what I want is to stop
being controlled by my dad.

00:33:56.846 --> 00:33:57.871
But,

00:33:58.097 --> 00:34:02.393
I thought if there's one stage
in our plan that can go wrong,

00:34:04.395 --> 00:34:05.771
let's back out.

00:34:08.691 --> 00:34:09.984
Let’s not risk it anymore.

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:13.789
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

00:34:15.114 --> 00:34:16.191
Though,

00:34:16.216 --> 00:34:17.234
with Bank,

00:34:18.534 --> 00:34:19.577
I don't know.

00:34:20.244 --> 00:34:22.622
Backing out doesn't
seem like an option for him.

00:34:23.414 --> 00:34:24.874
Come on, let’s do one last regroup.

00:34:27.084 --> 00:34:29.420
Grace, Lin, last regroup.

00:34:30.796 --> 00:34:31.796
Yeah.

00:34:35.051 --> 00:34:36.385
So here’s what will happen.

00:34:38.471 --> 00:34:41.682
At 10pm, Kuya Fidel will start his shift.

00:34:44.685 --> 00:34:46.062
Sir, just checking.

00:34:46.062 --> 00:34:47.063
Yes.

00:34:55.696 --> 00:34:57.531
Before 12 midnight,

00:34:58.024 --> 00:35:01.444
the food packs should already be delivered
for the employees’ midnight break.

00:35:10.961 --> 00:35:12.063
How’s it going?

00:35:12.088 --> 00:35:13.064
All good.

00:35:13.089 --> 00:35:15.007
We already placed the
phone in the food pack.

00:35:15.383 --> 00:35:17.385
The utility will bring it in now.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:19.670
Okay.

00:35:20.199 --> 00:35:21.576
I hope you weren’t recognized.

00:35:23.891 --> 00:35:25.726
And once the food is inside,

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:30.564
Kuya Fidel needs to find his food
pack with the label chicken adobo...

00:35:30.773 --> 00:35:31.691
- Papi.
- ...with no egg.

00:35:31.691 --> 00:35:34.068
Mine’s a special order.

00:35:34.068 --> 00:35:36.445
Chicken adobo labeled no egg.

00:35:36.696 --> 00:35:37.672
- No egg.
- No egg?

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:39.458
- Okay.
- Doesn’t look like it’s here, bro.

00:35:42.952 --> 00:35:43.536
Hey.

00:35:43.536 --> 00:35:45.246
You guys aren’t eating mine, right?

00:35:45.413 --> 00:35:47.665
No way, this one has egg.

00:35:49.208 --> 00:35:51.210
Oh, this is pork adobo.

00:35:52.128 --> 00:35:54.271
You’re such a mess,
we’re already eating here.

00:35:54.296 --> 00:35:56.549
- Where is it?
- "Chicken adobo with no egg."

00:35:56.924 --> 00:35:57.858
Fidel,

00:35:57.883 --> 00:35:58.968
I think this is yours.

00:35:59.468 --> 00:36:00.282
Here.

00:36:01.204 --> 00:36:02.455
This one’s special.

00:36:02.972 --> 00:36:04.094
Hey, Fidel.

00:36:04.598 --> 00:36:05.725
Come here.

00:36:08.018 --> 00:36:09.018
Sir, eat.

00:36:10.604 --> 00:36:12.148
Fix the plate over there.

00:36:12.898 --> 00:36:15.151
Your guy didn’t fix the plate over there.

00:36:15.317 --> 00:36:16.485
Sir, dinner break.

00:36:16.485 --> 00:36:18.696
Can I please eat first?

00:36:19.613 --> 00:36:21.407
Later.

00:36:21.699 --> 00:36:23.117
Fix it over there.

00:36:23.117 --> 00:36:25.745
It’s like they’re not feeding you.

00:36:25.745 --> 00:36:27.163
This greedy bastard.

00:36:27.913 --> 00:36:28.497
Hurry!

00:36:28.497 --> 00:36:30.166
Yes, sir, I’ll follow.

00:36:30.666 --> 00:36:31.792
Right now.

00:36:32.084 --> 00:36:33.169
Come with me.

00:36:33.169 --> 00:36:34.044
Don’t let anyone touch—

00:36:34.044 --> 00:36:35.312
Hey, no one touches this.

00:36:35.337 --> 00:36:37.131
Whoever does, dies.

00:36:37.882 --> 00:36:39.550
Okay, fine!

00:36:40.384 --> 00:36:41.510
Like you’re the boss here!

00:36:46.098 --> 00:36:47.808
Before 1:00 a.m.,

00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:51.391
we should already receive a text
from Kuya Fidel that he has the phone.

00:36:52.108 --> 00:36:53.397
- Grace,
- Mmm?

00:36:53.397 --> 00:36:54.690
where’s the electrician?

00:36:57.943 --> 00:36:59.039
He’s on his way.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.362
He said he’s almost here.

00:37:02.388 --> 00:37:03.388
Okay.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.200
Pat,

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:10.664
get ready.

00:37:20.424 --> 00:37:23.177
Papi, where’s the food I set aside?

00:37:23.385 --> 00:37:24.391
I don’t know.

00:37:24.678 --> 00:37:26.931
Maybe it was thrown out into the trash.

00:37:34.021 --> 00:37:36.857
And by 12:30, their break should be over.

00:37:37.233 --> 00:37:39.109
Here, the color plates are ready.

00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:41.403
So, the brownout needs
to happen by this time.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:45.074
Why isn’t it happening yet?

00:37:45.074 --> 00:37:46.509
What happened?

00:37:46.534 --> 00:37:48.828
He need to cut the power out by now.

00:38:06.136 --> 00:38:07.680
Bank, the electrician’s here.

00:38:24.864 --> 00:38:25.985
Where the hell is it?

00:38:26.991 --> 00:38:28.784
What the hell is happening?

00:38:29.201 --> 00:38:30.035
Everything’s ruined!

00:38:30.035 --> 00:38:31.102
It’s still not done?!

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.429
Bank.

00:38:32.454 --> 00:38:33.706
We’re still on the initial step,

00:38:33.706 --> 00:38:34.832
but the plan isn’t being followed—

00:38:34.832 --> 00:38:35.907
Wait!

00:38:37.167 --> 00:38:38.167
Wait!

00:38:47.695 --> 00:38:49.905
It doesn’t matter if
Kuya Fidel doesn’t text.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:51.974
What matters is that he kills the power.

00:38:56.869 --> 00:38:58.162
Let’s wait.

00:39:18.667 --> 00:39:20.753
Can Kuya Fidel really pull this off?

00:39:23.923 --> 00:39:25.299
I’m out of time.

00:39:37.937 --> 00:39:38.985
What now, Bank?

00:39:40.122 --> 00:39:41.844
Looks like it’s not
happening, it’s almost 1:00 a.m.!

00:39:41.869 --> 00:39:43.133
There’s still one minute.

00:39:50.616 --> 00:39:51.992
- Oh, thank god.
- Yes!

00:39:52.701 --> 00:39:53.750
The power is off.

00:39:54.036 --> 00:39:54.845
Pat,

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:56.455
in 15 minutes you’ll go in.

00:40:06.757 --> 00:40:09.510
Kuya Fidel will pretend to
be calling for an electrician.

00:40:10.094 --> 00:40:12.137
After 15 minutes of brownout,

00:40:12.763 --> 00:40:16.725
Pat will go in together with the real
electrician we hired for the building.

00:40:23.148 --> 00:40:24.566
Alright, take care.

00:40:25.985 --> 00:40:27.328
Sir, let’s check your stuff.

00:40:27.861 --> 00:40:29.154
Oh boy, you’re drenched in sweat.

00:40:30.781 --> 00:40:31.875
Ah.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.759
Ah, yes boss,

00:40:33.784 --> 00:40:35.828
our vehicle’s aircon is broken.

00:40:35.828 --> 00:40:36.914
Is that so?

00:40:37.639 --> 00:40:39.724
And boss, I really sweat a lot.

00:40:39.832 --> 00:40:40.499
Alright.

00:40:40.499 --> 00:40:42.001
Please leave your cellphones here.

00:40:42.001 --> 00:40:43.001
Okay.

00:40:45.904 --> 00:40:47.982
Please work quickly.

00:40:48.007 --> 00:40:49.341
We’re chasing a deadline.

00:40:50.465 --> 00:40:51.492
Okay.

00:40:52.094 --> 00:40:56.031
Ah boss, may I use the
restroom? I really need to pee.

00:40:56.056 --> 00:40:58.075
Oh, Fidel, why are you still here?

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.019
Boss, I’ll accompany him to the restroom.

00:41:00.649 --> 00:41:01.603
I really need to pee too.

00:41:01.603 --> 00:41:03.497
Go on, take him to the restroom.

00:41:03.522 --> 00:41:04.415
Then,

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.607
head outside.

00:41:05.607 --> 00:41:06.583
Thank you, boss.

00:41:06.608 --> 00:41:07.710
Quickly.

00:41:07.735 --> 00:41:08.828
Thank you, boss.

00:41:12.031 --> 00:41:13.173
Come with me.

00:41:13.198 --> 00:41:14.211
Okay, boss.

00:41:16.618 --> 00:41:17.618
Come here.

00:41:20.664 --> 00:41:22.166
It smells bad here.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:27.012
Why did you bring me here, bro?

00:41:27.037 --> 00:41:27.980
What happened?

00:41:28.005 --> 00:41:29.102
Because...

00:41:29.715 --> 00:41:30.766
the cellphone,

00:41:32.051 --> 00:41:33.094
is missing.

00:41:37.264 --> 00:41:38.307
The cellphone,

00:41:39.641 --> 00:41:40.976
- is missing.
- Huh?

00:41:43.145 --> 00:41:44.705
Bank, can we
still pull this off?

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:47.041
Almost 2:00 AM now but Pat
still hasn't sent anything.

00:41:47.066 --> 00:41:48.078
Yeah, Bank.

00:41:48.525 --> 00:41:50.444
Lord, we are totally
blind out here.

00:41:50.778 --> 00:41:52.654
And I'm so worried for Pat.

00:41:54.239 --> 00:41:55.674
We don't have time left.

00:41:55.699 --> 00:41:57.743
If they can't manage to
take pictures of the exam paper,

00:41:57.743 --> 00:42:00.079
I'll just do it myself and
I'll figure a way to get them.

00:42:00.871 --> 00:42:01.871
Bank!

00:42:02.836 --> 00:42:04.414
Why is there an
electrician here?

00:42:05.167 --> 00:42:07.503
Sorry, but Boss
Choi asked me to say

00:42:07.503 --> 00:42:09.588
that you're not needed now.

00:42:09.588 --> 00:42:10.881
Wait, I'll call Choi.

00:42:10.881 --> 00:42:12.766
Sorry Miss, it's not my fault.

00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:14.149
I'm just doing my job.

00:42:16.261 --> 00:42:18.514
What the hell?
What are you doing?

00:42:24.144 --> 00:42:27.860
The person with you still
hasn't shown up. Where is he?

00:42:28.315 --> 00:42:30.692
Check the CCTV monitor.

00:42:30.692 --> 00:42:32.236
We just need to
look for something.
